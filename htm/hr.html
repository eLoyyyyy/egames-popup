			<p>This is a horse betting game with virtual horses and a variety of betting options.</p>

			Horses:

			<p>On the left, there is a list of horses participating in the upcoming race. Click on their names to view and compare them (up to two horses can be displayed at a time). The “Points” column reflects the current form of the horse. The higher the points, the lower the payout for that horse.</p>

			Going and weather:

			<p>Status of the going and weather are displayed in the upper right corner of the screen. These affect the horses just like in a real race. The effect is more or less equal on all horses, though.</p>

			Bets:

			<p>In the center of the screen, there is a table showing all bets you have made for the current race. You can place up to nine bets per race. If you want to cancel a bet, click on X in the rightmost column of that bet.</p>

			<p>Payouts are calculated according to horse point amounts, going and weather.</p>

			<p>If the payout for a horse is below 1, it appears on a red background. Bets for these horses are not allowed.</p>

			<h4>These are the different kinds of bets:</h4>

			<ul>
				<li><p><strong>Winner</strong> &mdash; This is the simplest bet. You win, if the horse you selected, wins the race.</p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Exacta</strong> &mdash; You need to predict which horse finishes first and which one second. This is harder to guess correctly, so the payout is higher as well.</p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Place</strong> &mdash; You win, if the horse you selected, finishes first or second.</p></li>

				<li><p><strong>Show</strong> &mdash; You win, if the horse you selected, finishes first, second or third.</p></li>
			</ul>


			<p>Pick IV-V &mdash; Here you need to predict the first four or five horses in the exact order. It is up to you, whether you predict four or five horses. Five horses is harder to predict, so it pays better.</p>

			<p>When you have placed your bets, click Race to start the race! If any of your bets win, you are paid according to the payout for these bets. Multiple wins are added up.</p>

			<h4>Return to Player</h4>
			<p>The overall theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) in Derby Day is 95.00%.</p>
