			<p><strong>5-Reel 50-line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The object of The Six Million Dollar Man is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking + and - adjacent to <strong>Line Bet</strong> to increase or decrease the amount.</li>
			<li>The game is played with 50 active paylines. The number of paylines is fixed and cannot be changed by the player.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Bionic Spin</strong> spins the reels with the currently selected line bet. However, the total bet is 50% higher than the one in the regular spin mode. In return, the player is granted from 0 to 5 random Wild symbols per spin. During the reel spins the <strong>Bionic Spin</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Paylines are chosen by clicking <strong>Lines</strong>. Each click activates a payline. When all paylines are activated, clicking the button again resets it to one active payline. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the currently selected bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spins the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Mouse over the <strong>Auto Play</strong> button to display the list of options. Select the number of spins to be played automatically or choose &lsquo;Until Feature&rsquo; to spin until the Free Games round is triggered. Clicking on an option starts the Auto Play function. The entire amount of automatic spins that have been chosen will be played with the total bet of the last spin - either regular or Bionic. The <strong>Auto Play</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Play mode. The Auto Play mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the Free Games round is triggered if you chose 'Until Feature', or when you click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the <strong>Prev</strong> and <strong>Next</strong> buttons in the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Bionic Spin</strong> screen describes how the Bionic spin mode is activated and explains its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Bionic Free Games</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to trigger the Free Games feature and describes its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Paylines</strong> screen illustrates the paylines and explains the rules for calculating their wins.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels as illustrated on the <strong>Paylines</strong> screen of the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>All 50 active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the left most reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Maximum Win Limit</strong></p>
			<p>The maximum win in the game has an upper limit. For more information, see the Terms and Conditions section.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>Wild Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol <img src="../img/gtssmdm_wild.jpg" alt="" /> can stand for any other symbol, except Scatter, to make the best possible winning combination. There is also a separate payout for 2 or more Wild symbols on an active payline, as seen in the Paytable. This is paid out instead of the regular symbol win if the win amount from Wilds is larger than the win from the regular symbols (by Wild standing in).</p>
			<p>The Wild symbol can appear either stacked or non-stacked, as explained below.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols <img src="../img/gtssmdm_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> do not have to occur on any particular payline. If there are 2 or more Scatters in any position in the spin results, the payout is multiplied by the total bet and added to the payline winnings, if any.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Scatter payout is always multiplied by the regular spin total bet, regardless of whether the player has used the Bionic or the regular spin mode.</p>
			<p>If 3 or more Scatter symbols appear simultaneously anywhere on the reels during the main game, the Bionic Free Games round is triggered. More information on the Free Games can be found <a href="../img/gtssmdm.html#bionic_free_games">here</a>.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>Stacked Symbols</strong></p>
			<p>The symbols of <img src="../img/gtssmdm_oscar.jpg" alt="" />, <img src="../img/gtssmdm_heartbeat.jpg" alt="" />, <img src="../img/gtssmdm_radar.jpg" alt="" />, <img src="../img/gtssmdm_bleg.jpg" alt="" />, <img src="../img/gtssmdm_barm.jpg" alt="" /> and <img src="../img/gtssmdm_beye.jpg" alt="" /> can either appear stacked - in groups of 2, one above the other, or non-stacked - occupying a single position on the reels. Likewise, the symbol of <img src="../img/gtssmdm_wild.jpg" alt="" /> can appear either stacked - in groups of 4, or non-stacked during the main game and the Free Games.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>Bionic Spin Mode</strong></p>
			<p>In addition to the regular spin mode, there is a Bionic spin mode. By clicking the <strong>Bionic Spin</strong> button in the right-hand corner of the game window, the player invests an additional 50% of the total bet in the spin. In return, he is granted from 0 to 5 random Wilds per spin. This makes higher payouts possible.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Bionic Spin mode is available during the main game only.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><a name="bionic_free_games"></a><strong>Bionic Free Games</strong></p>
			<p>3 or more <img src="../img/gtssmdm_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> symbols, appearing simultaneously in any position on the reels during the main game, trigger 15 Free Games with a collective feature.</p>
			<p>At the beginning of the Free Games round, a message appears saying that you win 15 Free Games.</p>
			<p>To start the Free Games, click on <strong>Start Free Games</strong>.</p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the player can collect symbols to win 2 more Free Games and additional Wilds.</p>
			<p>The symbols need to be collected in a specific order. The first symbol to be collected is the bionic leg - <img src="../img/gtssmdm_bleg.jpg" alt="" />. The second one is the bionic arm - <img src="../img/gtssmdm_barm.jpg" alt="" />. The third one is the bionic eye - <img src="../img/gtssmdm_beye.jpg" alt="" />. Only one bionic part can be collected per spin. This means that if 2 bionic parts appear in the spin results, e.g. an arm and a leg, only 1 of them will be collected as per the collecting order.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> The symbols need to be stacked in order to be collected. Non-stacked symbols will not be collected.</p>
			<p>The collected symbols are highlighted on the progress bar to the right of the reels. Once all 3 symbols have been collected, the collective feature starts over and the progress bar is reset.</p>
			<p>When the player collects the 3 bionic parts, a Wild symbol is added to the stacked Wilds on each reel and 2 more Free Games are won.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> New Wilds can be added up to 5 times. This means that if the player collects the 3 symbols for the 6th, 7th, etc. time, 2 more Free Games will only be won; Wilds will not be added to the reels. </p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same bet per line as on the spin that won the Free Games. The Free Games can only be played with the regular spin total bet and not with the bionic spin total bet. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the main game spin that won the Free Games. <strong>Feature win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up).</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize. Free Game wins are added to the payline wins.</p>
			<p>If the Free Games are triggered during the Auto Play mode, the feature begins after the player clicks on <strong>Start Free Games</strong>. When all Free Games have been played and the player clicks <strong>Continue</strong> on the screen summarizing the Free Games win, the Auto Play mode resumes. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 93.97%.</p>
