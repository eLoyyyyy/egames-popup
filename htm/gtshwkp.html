			<p><strong>5-Reel 9-line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Highway Kings Pro is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Line Bet</strong> to increase or decrease the amount.</li>
			<li>Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Lines</strong>. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the currently selected bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spins the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Mouse over the <strong>Auto Play</strong> button to display the list of options. Select the number of spins to be played automatically or choose <strong>Until Feature</strong> to spin until the Truck Racing Bonus round is triggered. Clicking on an option starts the Auto Play function. The <strong>Auto Play</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Play mode. The Auto Play mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the Truck Racing Bonus round is triggered if you chose <strong>Until Feature</strong>, or when you click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>In the case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Truck Racing Bonus</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to trigger the Bonus feature on the reels and describes its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Paylines</strong> screen illustrates all possible payline combinations and explains the payout rules in the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels. Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking + or &ndash; below <strong>Lines</strong>.</li>
			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			</ul>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Both during main game and Free Games winning combinations on active paylines pay both directions: from left to right and from right to left.</li>
			<li>If there are multiple simultaneous wins in either direction, the highest paying winning combination in each direction counts.</li>
			<li>One and the same active payline can pay twice after a single spin. However, 5-of-a-kind wins are paid only once.</li>
			<li>Left to right winning combinations must start from the leftmost reel and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			<li>Right to left winning combinations must start from the rightmost reel and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			<li>If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are added up.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Maximum Win Limit</strong></p>
			<p>The maximum win in the game has an upper limit. For more information, see the Terms and Conditions section.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol <img src="../img/gtshwkp_wild.jpg" alt="" /> appears only on reels #2, #3 and #4. It can stand for any other symbol, except <img src="../img/gtshwkp_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> and <img src="../img/gtshwkp_bonus.jpg" alt="" /> , to make the best possible winning combination.</p>
			<p>Wild symbol combinations do not pay separately.</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols <img src="../img/gtshwkp_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> do not have to occur on any particular payline. If there are 3 or more Scatters anywhere on the reels after a main game or a Free Games spin, the payout earned is multiplied by the total bet and added to payline winnings, if any.</p>
			<p><strong>Bonus Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Bonus symbol <img src="../img/gtshwkp_bonus.jpg" alt="" /> appears only on reels #1 and #5.

			<p>The Truck Racing Bonus leads directly to the Free Games round. More information about the Free Games can be found <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
			<p><a name="truckracingbonus_section"></a><strong>Truck Racing Bonus</strong></p>

Pick one of the vehicles by clicking on the respective arrow, thus winning between 10 and 25 Free Games. When the screens change and 3 speedways are shown, choose 1 of them so that the truck you have previously picked will be able to compete in the truck race which follows. Depending on the place your truck has won at the end of the truck race you are awarded a Free Games spin multiplier between 2 and 5.</p>
			<p>After you click <strong>Continue</strong>, the Free Games round begins.</p>
			<p><a name="freegames_section"></a><strong>Free Games</strong></p>
			<p>After the Truck Racing Bonus has ended, the Free Games that have been won during the bonus game begin. The multiplier awarded during the bonus round applies to all payline and Scatter winnings won during the Free Games round.</p>
			<p>If <img src="../img/gtshwkp_bonus.jpg" alt="" /> appears anywhere on reels #1 and #5 simultaneously after a Free Games spin, you will be awarded 20 Free Games additionally. Thus Free Games can be infinitely won.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same number of lines and bets per line as on the spin that won the Truck Racing Bonus. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the main game spin that won the Truck Racing Bonus. <strong>Feature win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up). If there were no winnings in the main game reels that triggered the Truck Racing Bonus, only <strong>Total win</strong> will be shown.</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize. <strong>Free Game</strong> wins are added to the payline wins.</p>
			<p>If the Truck Racing Bonus and respectively the Free Games that follow have been triggered during the Auto Play mode, the Free Games round begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. When all Free Games have been played and the player clicks <strong>Continue</strong>on the screen summarizing the Free Games win, the Auto Play mode resumes. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 94.99%.</p>
