			<p>You play against the computer. Here are the rules:</p>

			<p>Rock beats Scissors</p>
			<p>Scissors beats Paper </p>
			<p>Paper beats Rock</p>

			<p>First, choose a bet amount by clicking on the + and - buttons in the lower left corner of the screen. If you lose the game, you lose your bet amount. If it is a draw (both you and the computer make the same move), your bet is returned. If you win the game, you are paid 1.9 times your bet.</p>

			<p>Winning Streak Bets:</p>

			<p>You can also bet on a winning streak. To win the bet, you have to win many games in a row. Winning streak bets for 2, 3 or 4 matches are available. Choose one of them by clicking on the icon on the right hand side of the screen. You must win the corresponding number of matches in a row. Draw means you lose the bet. The winning streak mode remains active until you click Quit Streak Bet.</p>

			<h4>Return to Player</h4>
			<p>The total theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) in Rock-Paper-Scissors is 96.67%.</p>
