			<p><strong>5-Reel 20-line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Sultan's Gold is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Line Bet</strong> to increase or decrease the amount.</li>
			<li>Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Lines</strong>. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the currently selected bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spins the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Mouse over the <strong>Auto Play</strong> button to display the list of options. Select the number of spins to be played automatically or choose &lsquo;Until Feature&rsquo; to spin until the Free Games round is triggered. Clicking on an option starts the Auto Play function. The <strong>Auto Play</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Play mode. The Auto Play mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when a Free Games round is triggered if you chose &lsquo;Until Feature&rsquo;, or when you click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Free Games</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to trigger the Free Games feature and describes the Free Games feature rules.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Show Paylines</strong> on the <strong>Paytable</strong> page, opens a screen that illustrates all possible payline combinations. Clicking <strong>Hide Paylines</strong> closes this screen and returns to the <strong>Paytable</strong> page.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels. Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking + or &ndash; below <strong>Lines</strong>.</li>
			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the left most reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Maximum Win Limit</strong></p>
			<p>The maximum win in the game has an upper limit. For more information, see the Terms and Conditions section.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild Symbol</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> the symbol of the <img src="../img/gtsstg_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> is both Wild and Scatter in the game. More information about its Scatter-symbol behaviour can be found <a href="../img/gtsstg.html#scatter_section">below</a>.</p>
			<p>The Wild symbol in the game is the <img src="../img/gtsstg_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> during main game and the Free Games round. The Wild symbol can substitute for any other symbol in the game to make the best possible winning combination.</p>
			<p><strong><a name="scatter_section"></a>Scatter Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbol in the game is the <img src="../img/gtsstg_scatter.jpg" alt="" />. It does not have to occur on any particular payline. If there are 3 or more Scatter symbols in any position in the spin results, the payout earned is multiplied by the total bet and added to payline winnings.</p>
			<p>If 3 or more Scatter symbols appear in any position on the reels simultaneously during main game or Free Games, 10 Free Games with Mystery Scatter are won. More information about the Mystery Scatter can be found <a href="../img/gtsstg.html#mystery_scatter_section">here</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>Free Games</strong></p>
			<p>3 or more Scatter symbols, appearing simultaneously in any position on the reels during main game, trigger 10 Free Games with Mystery Scatter. 3 or more Scatters during Free Games retrigger 10 more Free Games with the same rules. Thus Free Games can be infinitely won.</p>
			<p><a name="mystery_scatter_section"></a>The Mystery Scatter can be any 1 of the symbols, except <img src="../img/gtsstg_scatter.jpg" alt="" />, automatically and randomly chosen after the Free Games have been won. During the Free Games round, that symbol behaves in a scatter type manner. This means that Mystery Scatter does not have to occur on any particular payline. Its combinations will pay whenever Mystery Scatter symbols appear in any position in the Free Games spin results, regardless of the lines. The payout is earned according to the original symbol&rsquo;s paytable multiplied by the total bet, at which the Free Games round has been triggered.</p>
			<p>To start the Free Games, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. A screen appears saying that 10 Free Games have been won, after which the automatic random selection of the Mystery Scatter symbol will commence. Immediately after that the Free Games round begins.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same number of lines and bets per line as on the spin that won the Free Games. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the spin that won the free games. <strong>Feature win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total win</strong> shows the aggregate winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up).</p>
			<p>If Free Games are triggered during the Auto Play mode, the feature begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. When all Free Games have been played and the player clicks <strong>Continue</strong> on the screen summarizing the Free Games win, the Auto Play mode resumes. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize. <strong>Free Game</strong> wins are added to the payline and Scatter wins.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 94.99%.</p>
