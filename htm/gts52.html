			<p><strong>5-Reel 20-line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Vikingmania is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Line Bet</strong> to increase or decrease the amount.</li>
			<li>Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Lines</strong>. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the currently selected bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spins the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Mouse over the <strong>Auto Play</strong> button to display the list of options. Select the number of spins to be played automatically or choose <strong>Until Feature</strong> to spin until a Bonus or the Free Games round is triggered. Clicking on an option starts the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. The <strong>Auto Play</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Play mode. The Auto Play mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when a Bonus or Free Games round is triggered if you chose <strong>Until Feature</strong>, or when you click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In the case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Free Games</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to trigger the Free Games feature and describes the Free Games feature rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Viking Playtime Bonus</strong> screen explains the symbol combinations necessary to enter the Bonus round and describes its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Paylines</strong> screen illustrates all possible payline combinations.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels. Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking + or &ndash; below <strong>Lines</strong>.</li>
			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the left most reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Maximum Win Limit</strong></p>
			<p>The maximum win in the game has an upper limit. For more information, see the Terms and Conditions section.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol <img src="../img/gts52_wild.jpg" alt="" /> appears only on reels 2, 3 and 4. It can stand for any other symbol, except Scatter and Activated Reel Symbol, to make the best possible winning combination.</p>
			<p>Wild symbol combinations do not pay separately.</p>
			<p>The Wild symbol acts as an Expanding Wild during Free Games. More information about Free Games can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols <img src="../img/gts52_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> do not have to occur on any particular payline. If there are two or more Scatters in any position in the spin results, the payout earned is multiplied by the total bet and added to payline winnings.</p>
			<p>If three or more Scatter symbols appear in any position on the reels simultaneously during main game, 10 Free Games are triggered. If three or more Scatter symbols appear in any position on the reels simultaneously during Free Games, the Free Games round is retriggered, as explained below.</p>
			<p><strong>Activated Reel Feature</strong></p>
			<p>The Activated Reel feature is active only in main game and is triggered by the appearance of the Hammer symbol <img src="../img/gts52_hammer.jpg" alt="" /> on the central position of the reels. Whenever this symbol appears on a reel, this reel becomes and remains activate. When all 5 reels have been activated, the Viking Playtime Bonus begins.</p>
			<p>Note that reels are activated separately for each total bet. If the player changes the total bet, then the activated reels of the previous total bet are inactive. If the player returns to the previously set total bet, then the previously activated reels are displayed and active.</p>
			<p><strong>Viking Playtime Bonus</strong></p>
			<p>The Viking Playtime Bonus is triggered only in main game by the activation of all 5 reels through the Activated Reel feature.</p>
			<p>To start the Viking Playtime Bonus, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>.</p>
			<p>A Viking is tied to a bulls-eye target. The player is presented with 6 weapons and has to pick any one at a time, by clicking on it, in an attempt to hit the target. Each successful hit results in a cash prize for the player with a multiplier of up to x3. The closer to the center of the target a weapon hits, the higher the multiplier of the bonus win. The Bonus round ends after 10 throws. Player will successfully hit the target at least 7 out of 10 times.</p>
			<p>At the end of the Bonus game, a win screen displays your winnings. <strong>Game win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the main game that won the Bonus. <strong>Feature win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Bonus. <strong>Total Win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up). If no winnings were received during the spin that won the Bonus, then only the <strong>Total Win</strong> field will be shown.</p>
			<p>Click <strong>Continue</strong> to return to the main game.</p>
			<p><strong>Free Games</strong></p>
			<p>Three or more Scatters in any position on the reels simultaneously during main game trigger 10 Free Games with a multiplier of x3.</p>
			<p>Three or more Scatters during Free Games retrigger the Free Games round with the same multiplier.</p>
			<p>The Viking Playtime Bonus cannot be triggered during Free Games.</p>
			<p>The Wild symbol becomes Expanding Wild during Free Games. Whenever the Wild symbol appears anywhere on a reel and creates a winning combination in any position of this reel, it expands to cover the entire reel. All positions on this reel become Wild. All resulting winning combinations are paid.</p>
			<p>To start the Free Games, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same number of lines and bets per line as on the spin that won the Free Games. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the spin that won the free games. <strong>Feature win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total win</strong> shows the aggregate winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up).</p>
			<p>If Free Games are triggered during the Auto Play mode, the feature begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. When all Free Games have been played and the player clicks <strong>Continue</strong> on the screen summarizing the Free Games win, the Auto Play mode resumes. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize. <strong>Free Game</strong> wins are added to the payline and Scatter wins.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 94.96%.</p>
