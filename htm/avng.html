			<p><strong>5-Reel 20-line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of The Avengers is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking + and - below <strong>Line Bet</strong> to increase or decrease the amount.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X 20. This is due to the fact that the game The Avengers is played using a fixed number of 20 active lines, no more, no less.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the currently selected bet. During the reel spin the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking<strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Mouse over the <strong>Auto Play</strong> button to display the list of options. Select the number of spins to be played automatically or choose <strong>Until Feature</strong> to spin until the Wall of Heroes Bonus is triggered. Clicking on an option starts the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. The <strong>Auto Play</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Play mode. The Auto Play mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the Wall of Heroes Bonus is triggered if you chose <strong>Until Feature</strong>, or when you click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In the case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>The Avengers Assemble On Reels Feature</strong> screen explains how this feature is triggered and how it pays.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Wall of Heroes Bonus</strong> screen explains how this Bonus feature is triggered and how to play it.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Captain America Free Games</strong> screen describes the rules of this feature.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Iron Man Free Games</strong> screen describes the rules of this feature.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Thor Free Games</strong> screen describes the rules of this feature.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Hulk Free Games</strong> screen describes the rules of this feature.</li>
			<li><strong>Marvel Multi-Level Mystery Progressive Jackpot</strong> screen describes how to win entry to the Marvel Multi-Level Mystery Progressive Jackpot game that wins one of four jackpots, and explains the game&rsquo;s rules.</li>

			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>All 20 lines are active during the game.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are added up.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the left most reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol <img src="../img/avng_wild.gif" alt="" /> can stand for any other symbol, except Scatter <img src="../img/avng_scatter.gif" alt="" /> to make the best possible winning combination. There is also a separate payout for 2 or more Wild symbols on an active payline, as seen in the Paytable. This is paid out instead of the regular symbol win if the win amount from Wild is larger than the win from the regular symbols (by Wild standing in).</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols do not have to occur on any particular payline. If there are 3 or more Scatter symbols in any position in the spin results, the payout earned is multiplied by the total bet and added to payline winnings.</p>
			<p>In addition, 3 or more Scatter symbols anywhere trigger the Wall of Heroes Bonus with 4 Free Games modes.</p>
			<p><strong>The Avengers Assemble On Reels Feature</strong></p>
			<p>When Captain America <img src="../img/avng_captainamerica.gif" alt="" />, Iron Man <img src="../img/avng_ironman.gif" alt="" />, Thor <img src="../img/avng_thor.gif" alt="" />, Hulk <img src="../img/avng_hulk.gif" alt="" /> and Nick Fury <img src="../img/avng_nickfury.gif" alt="" /> symbols appear consecutively in any order on an active payline, starting with the leftmost reel, a cash prize of 200 times the line bet is awarded. This feature is available only during main game. During the feature it is possible for a winning combination to occur on more than 1 payline; in this case both will pay.</p>
			<p><strong>Wall of Heroes Bonus</strong></p>
			<p>To start the feature, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>.</p>
			<p>In the Wall of Heroes Bonus, the player is presented with a wall of 20 icons to pick from until 3 of the same hero are revealed to start that hero&rsquo;s Free Games: Captain America, Thor, Iron Man or Hulk.</p>
			<p>Uncovering a Loki <img src="../img/avng_loki.gif" alt="" /> symbol ends the Bonus and sends you back to main game. The player will always win at least one mode of Free Games when first triggered (Loki won&rsquo;t be among the icons during the 1st round of the Bonus).<br />When any of the Free Games modes ends, the Wall of Heroes screen re-appears, making it possible for the player to win more Free Games of another or the same kind. Re-triggering of Free Games is possible during the Wall of Heroes Bonus only.</p>
			<p>During all 4 modes of Free Games spins, the reels are spun automatically using the same bet per line as on the spin that won the Wall of Heroes Bonus. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field.The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>When the Loki symbol is uncovered and terminates the Bonus, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the main game spin that won the Wall of Heroes Bonus. <strong>Feature Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during all Free Games during the Wall of Heroes Bonus. <strong>Total Win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up). Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p>If the Wall of Heroes Bonus is triggered during the Auto Play mode, the feature begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. Next, the player makes picks until 3 of the same hero are found and the respective Free Games start automatically. These steps repeat until uncovering the Loki symbol terminates the Bonus. Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> on the screen summarizing the whole Bonus Free Games win resumes the Auto Play mode in main game.</p>
			<p><strong>Captain America Free Games</strong></p>

			<p><strong>Marvel Mystery Jackpot</strong></p>
			<p>Marvel Mystery Jackpot is a multi-level progressive jackpot game that is available in all Marvel games and is linked to all Marvel games. A small percentage of each bet in the Marvel games, by every person playing this game in each of many online casinos, is added to the progressive jackpot.</p>
			<p>The trigger that starts the Jackpot game is random and can occur after any spin in any of the linked games. It is not caused by any symbol combination in the linked games and even a spin that does not win anything in the main game can trigger the Jackpot game. Likewise, any bet with any size in the linked games can trigger the Jackpot game. Nonetheless, the chances of triggering the Jackpot game increase or decrease proportionally to the bet size. Entering the Jackpot game guarantees a win of one of the four jackpots. Playing the Jackpot game reveals the jackpot that has been awarded to you, but does not determine it.</p>
			<p>There are four different levels of jackpots that you can win: Power Jackpot, Extra Power Jackpot, Super Power Jackpot and Ultimate Power Jackpot. Different types of jackpots hold different prize amounts. The jackpot gamescreen contains 20 squares which in the beginning of the gameplay are turned upside down. Clicking on a square will turn it around and reveal one of four jackpot symbols on the other side. Once you have found three matching symbols, you win the jackpot that corresponds to these symbols. Jackpot winnings are added to the main game winnings (if any) and are displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field together with any other winnings.</p>
			<p>The Marvel Mystery Jackpot game has a timeout timer. This means that if you do not pick a square in a set amount of time, you will automatically receive your prize.</p>
			<p>The Jackpot for this game works like this:</p>
			<table class="table">
			<tbody>
			<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>Seed</strong> (how much money the Jackpots start out with):</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Power: &euro;50<br />Extra Power: &euro;500<br />Super Power: &euro;5,000<br />Ultimate Power: &euro;100,000</p>
			</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>Contribution rate</strong> (what percentage of each bet goes into Jackpot):</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>0.99%</p>
			</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>Win condition</strong> (the result you have to get to win the Jackpot):</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Entering the jackpot game guarantees a win. Match 3 jackpot symbols of the corresponding Jackpot or wait for the timer to run out.</p>
			</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>Win requirements</strong> (what you need to do to be eligible for the Jackpot):</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Play a Marvel game.</p>
			</td>
			</tr>
			</tbody>
			</table>
			<p><strong>Please note:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>The seed and Jackpot values are in Euros in the progressive network and their value in your local currency is dependent on the currency exchange rate.</li>
			<li>The mechanics of Marvel Mystery Jackpot prohibit simultaneous jackpot winnings.</li>
			<li>Imperfections in the Internet connectivity may cause you to experience delays in Jackpot messages or updates, but they do not affect actual Jackpot wins.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 95.02 %.</p>
