			<p>The object of Final Score is to guess the outcome of a football match.</p>

			<h4>Leagues</h4>
			<p>In Final Score, the player can choose to bet on the outcome between a football match between two teams. The teams can be chosen from the major leagues in Europe. When you launch the game, the Select a League screen is shown to you. Click on one of the leagues so the arrow next to its name is blue. This means that this league is now selected. Click Continue to enter the game with the selected league. The active league can later easily be changed during the course of the gameplay by clicking Change league on the top left part of the game window.</p>

			<h4>Teams</h4>
			<p>After you have chosen your league, you can now choose two teams from this league and predict the outcome of a game between them. The teams can be chosen from the dropdown menus in the top left part of the game window. The team on the left will be the home team, and the team on the right will be the away team. You can also click Random fixture, which will randomly pit two teams from the selected league against each other.</p>

			<h4>To play the game:</h4>

			<ul>
			<li><p>On the lower left part of the game window are icons of chips with different values. Click on a chip with the desired value to select it. The selected chip will have a red circle around it.</p></li>
			<li><p>To place your bet:</p>
				<ul>
				<li><p>There are four types of bets: match bet, correct score bet, total goals bet and special bet. The bets can be made on the middle of the left part of the game window.</p></li>
				<li><p>Match bet is a bet that either the home side or the away side will win the match or that it will end in a draw. To place a match bet, choose one or more of the options in the Match Betting area.</p></li>
				<li><p>Correct score bet is a bet that the match will end with a certain scoreline. To place a correct score bet, choose one or more of the scorelines under the Home To Win, Draw and Away To Win headings in the Correct Score Betting area. Note that the Other betting option covers the results that are not listed in a particular betting area. For example, if you choose the Other option under the Draw heading, and the match ends in 4-4, you have won.</p></li>
				<li><p>Total Goals bet is a bet on the number of total goals that will be scored by the two teams, regardless of who scored them or who won the match. To place a Total Goals bet; choose one or more of the options in the Total Goals betting area.</p></li>
				<li><p>By choosing &ldquo;Specials&rdquo;, you bet that a particular event will happen during the match. It does not matter if the special event happens once or more during a match. To place special bets, choose one or more of the options in the Specials betting area.</p></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><p>When placing a bet, holding the mouse cursor over a particular bet shows its bet odds in the lower right part of the game window under the Bet Odds heading. Bet odds can be shown in two formats, decimals and fractions. The format type can be changed by clicking View Decimal Odds and View Fractional Odds.</p></li>
			<li><p>The strength of the teams in real life is reflected in Final Score. This also affects the bet odds. The bet odds will be lower if the outcome is more likely, and vice versa. Also, if a team is playing at home, they will perform better than if they were playing away and this also affects the bet odds.</p></li>
			<li><p>All the bets you have made are marked with a chip.</p></li>
			<li><p>Clicking on an already existing bet will increment its size by one selected chip value.</p></li>
			<li><p>The minimum and maximum bet limits are dependent on your VIP level.</p></li>
			<li><p>If you wish to increase the bet by a different amount, select another chip value and place your bet.</p></li>
			<li><p>To decrease or remove a placed bet, click either Clear Last Bet or Clear All Bets in the lower middle part of the game window. Clear Last Bet will remove the most recently placed chip and Clear All Bets will remove all the chips.</p></li>
			<li><p>You can place several bets, even in one betting area. Your total bet is shown in the lower middle part of the game window in the Total Bet field.</p></li>
			<li><p>Click Bet Now to confirm all the placed bets and start the football match. If no bets are placed, the football match does not start and the player is shown an error message.</p></li>
			<li><p>The football match will now be shown to you. You will see animations in the middle of the game window when an important game event happens, for example if one team scores a goal or if a red card is shown to a player. The game events are also listed chronologically in the lower middle part of the game window. You can skip the match and see the results instantly by clicking Full time right of the time counter.</p></li>
