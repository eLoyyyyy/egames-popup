			<p>The object of Hold'em Showdown is to predict the hand that will win the Texas Hold’em all-in showdown.</p>

			<h4>Texas Hold'Em Rules</h4>

			<p>The poker variation known as Texas Hold'em is currently the most popular poker game in the world.</p>

			<p>In the beginning of a Texas Hold’em gameplay round, two cards are dealt to each player. These cards are known as &lquo;pocket cards&rquo; or &lquo;hole cards&rquo;. These cards are not known to other players and only the player who these cards were dealt to may use them for a card combination.</p>

			<p>Once the pocket cards are on the table, the Flop is dealt. Flop consists of three “community cards” that are placed in the centre of the game table for everyone to see. After the Flop, the fourth community card is dealt. This is known as the Turn, This is followed by the River, which is the fifth and final community card.</p>

			<p>Every player can see the community cards and each player can use any combination of the community cards and their own pocket cards to construct the best five-card poker hand that they can. The player who has the best hand is declared the winner of this round and takes all the bets in the pot. In the case of a draw, the pot is split evenly between the players with equal winning hands.</p>

			<h4>Poker Hands</h4>

			<p>One Pair - a pair of cards of equal value, e.g. Q, Q.</p>

			<p>Two Pair - two separate pairs of equal value cards, e.g. 10, 10, K, K</p>

			<p>Three of a Kind - three cards of the same value, e.g. 8, 8, 8.</p>

			<p>Straight - Five cards consecutive in value, but not in the same suit, e.g. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. If the cards are in the same suit as well, it is a Straight Flush (see below).</p>

			<p>Flush - Any five cards in the same suit, but not consecutive in value, e.g. 4 of Diamonds, 8 of Diamonds, 9 of Diamonds, J of Diamonds, K of Diamonds.</p>

			<p>Full House - a combination of a Three of a Kind and a pair, e.g. 8, 8, 8, J, J.</p>

			<p>Four of a Kind - four cards equal in value, e.g. 5, 5, 5, 5.</p>

			<p>Straight Flush - five cards consecutive in value and in the same suit, e.g. 5 of Clubs, 6 of Clubs, 7 of Clubs, 8 of Clubs, 9 of Clubs.</p>

			<p>Five of a Kind - five cards of the same value. Since there are only four suits, this combination can only occur in games with a wild card, such as Deuces Wild and Joker Poker.</p>

			<p>Royal Flush - Ace, King, Queen, Jack and 10 all in the same suit.</p>

			<h4>Poker Hand Names</h4>

			<p>Throughout the long history of Texas Hold’em, all different pocket card combinations have acquired nicknames. The box left of the Dealer cards contains interesting information about the names of the pocket card combination that the Dealer currently has.</p>

			<h4>All-in Showdown</h4>

			<p>The All-in Showdown event is the most infamous and dramatic moment of a Texas Hold’em game. It happens when two or more players bet all their remaining chips before some or all of the community cards have been dealt. The players then reveal their cards and community cards are dealt. As the players have bet all their chips it often means that the losers are eliminated from the tournament.</p>

			<p>To play the game:</p>

			<ul>
			<li><p>On the lower right part of the game window is the Bet size selection area. Use the + and – icons to choose the desired Bet size. This will be the initial active Bet that you start the game with.</p></li>
			<li><p>Click Deal to deal the four sets of Opponent cards and the Dealer cards. The four pairs of cards in the lower middle part of the game window are the four sets of Opponent cards. The two cards in the upper middle part of the game window are the Dealer cards.</p></li>
			<li><p>You must choose one of the four sets of Opponent cards and then predict whether the Dealer or the chosen Opponent will win the all-in showdown.</p></li>
			<li><p>In each game round, only one Opponent can be chosen, and they always play against the Dealer. It is not possible to have two or more Opponents play against each other, or to have more than one Opponent play against the dealer.</p></li>
			<li><p>Choose your bet:</p>
			<ul>
			<li><p>Next to each set of Opponent cards are two buttons with the text Win. The label Dealer is above one of the Win buttons and the label Opponent is below the other Win button.</p></li>
			<li><p>Click Win under the text Dealer to bet that the Dealer will win this all-in showdown. Click Win above the text Opponent to bet that this Opponent will win this all-in showdown.</p></li>
			<li><p>The cards of the Opponents that were not chosen will be removed and the remaining community cards will be dealt – first the Flop, then the Turn, and then the River.</p></li>
			<li><p>The winner will be revealed. The cards that belong to the best card combination will be highlighted while the remaining cards will be faded out. A different sound effect will be played depending on whether you won or lost.</p></li>
			<li><p>If you win, you can continue with your current stake, or bank half or all of it. If you lose, you lose your active bet and must make a new initial bet.</p></li>
			<li><p>Instead of choosing a bet and clicking Win, you can also click Shuffle if you are not happy with the current Opponent cards. Shuffling will remove all the four sets of Opponent hands and deal new ones. The Dealer hand will remain the same. You start with 3 initial shuffles and can gain new ones as you continue to play.</p></li>
			<li><p>Next to the Opponent and Dealer texts above and below the Win buttons are shown the amount that you will win if you guess correctly. The number shown there is the total stake amount that you will have after this game round if you win. It already includes your current bet.</p></li>
			<li><p>The potential winnings are based on your bet as well as the winning probability. If the combination is more likely to win, you will win less if you choose it and win. If the card combination is very unlikely to win against better pocket cards, you will win a lot more if your chosen cards win after the community cards have been dealt.</p></li>
			<li><p>If you win, you do not have to choose a new bet amount manually. Instead, your current stake is carried over to the next game round as the bet. However, you have the possibility of banking either half of your entire current stake by clicking either Bank All or Bank Half. Banking means that the stake money is added to the account balance. If the whole active stake is banked, you must choose a new initial bet and click Deal to start a new round of gameplay.</p></li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><p>It is also possible that both the Dealer’s best hand and the Opponent’s best hand are exactly equal after the community cards have been dealt. In that case this round ends in a draw. You do not win nor lose anything, and your bet for this round is returned to you.</p></li>
			<li><p>If you guess wrongly, you will lose your whole active stake and must begin the new gaming round by again choosing the initial bet size.</p></li>
			<li><p>The minimum and maximum bet limits depend on your VIP level.</p></li>
			<li><p>If your active stake is very high, winning some of the bets may take you over your allowed bet limit. In this case, it is not possible for you to make these bets. You can choose the bets that do not take you over the stake limit. If all of the bets take you over the allowed limit, you must bank half of your winnings to continue this round with lower stakes, or bank all of your winnings to end gameplay.</p></li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Return to Player</h4>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is from 93.42% up to 97.00% depending on the denomination used.</p>
