			<p><strong>5-Reel 40-line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Tennis Stars is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>A wagering denomination (coin value) can be chosen by clicking the <strong>Click to Change</strong> denomination button in the lower left-hand corner of the screen.</li>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking <strong>Bet per Line</strong>. Each click adds a coin to the line bet. When the maximum amount is reached (10 coins of the selected wagering denomination), clicking the button again resets the line bet to one coin.</li>
			<li>Paylines are chosen by clicking <strong>Lines</strong>. Each click activates a payline. When all paylines are activated, clicking the button again resets it to one active payline. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the currently selected bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spins the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Start</strong> function. Clicking + or &ndash; above <strong>Auto Start</strong> selects the successive number of spins to be enabled. Clicking <strong>Auto Start</strong> spins the reels. The <strong>Auto Start</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Start mode. The Auto Start mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the player clicks<strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In the case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			<li>Any win below the Gamble feature limit can activate the <strong>Gamble</strong> button which, when clicked, starts the Gamble feature. More information about the Gamble feature can be found below.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Championship Bonus</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to enter the Championship Bonus game and describes its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Free Games</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to trigger the Free Games feature and describes the Free Games feature rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Gamble</strong> screen describes how to try doubling winnings by gambling with them and describes the doubling-up rules.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Show Paylines</strong> on the <strong>Paytable</strong> page, opens a screen that illustrates all possible payline combinations. Clicking <strong>Hide Paylines</strong> closes this screen and returns to the <strong>Paytable</strong> page.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels. Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking <strong>Lines</strong>.</li>
			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the left most reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol <img src="../img/tst_wild.jpg" alt="" /> can appear on reels 2, 3 or 4 only. It can stand for any other symbol, except Scatter, to make the best possible winning combination.</p>
			<p>Wild can trigger the Free Games Feature while in the main game and win more Free Games during the Free Games Feature. In addition, 3 or more Wilds win a cash prize of 10 times the total bet both in main and Free Games. More information on this can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols <img src="../img/tst_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> do not have to occur on any particular payline. If there are two or more Scatters in the spin results, the payout earned is multiplied by the total bet and added to payline winnings.</p>
			<p>If three or more Scatter symbols appear in any position on the reels simultaneously, during the main game or during Free Games, the Championship Bonus is triggered.</p>
			<p><strong>Championship Bonus</strong></p>
			<p>To start the Championship Bonus round, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>.</p>
			<p>A screen appears, explaining the game rules. Click on <strong>Continue</strong> to begin.</p>
			<p>First, the player chooses whether to play men&rsquo;s or women&rsquo;s singles. This choice affects only the game graphics but has no relation to the game score, how the match is played or to the win. Once that choice is made, a single tennis match of up to 6 rounds will begin. The Bonus always ends when the player wins 4 rounds.<br />For each round of the game, the player chooses how to serve the ball: with a &lsquo;Flat Serve&rsquo; or with a &lsquo;Slice Serve&rsquo;. Aces (serves that go unanswered by the opponent) increase the win multiplier, starting from X1 in steps of +1. It is possible not to win aces for the whole game at all.</p>
			<p>The result from the match determines the cash win: the greater the point difference, the bigger your prize. You can beat your opponent against 0, 15 or 30 points, in which cases the cash prizes will be 50, 15 or 10 respectively. The overall Bonus win is equal to the cash prize won, times the multiplier won from aces (if any), times the total bet of the spin that triggered the Bonus. The maximum prize that can be won from the Championship Bonus round amounts to 250 times the total bet of the spin that triggered the Championship Bonus.<br />At the end of the Championship Bonus game, a win screen displays your winnings. Click <strong>Continue</strong> to return to the slot reels.</p>
			<p>If the Championship Bonus is triggered during the Auto Start mode, the feature begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong> and then<strong>Continue</strong> on the screen presenting the Championship Bonus. When the Championship Bonus is over and the player clicks <strong>Continue</strong> on the screen summarizing the Bonus win, the Auto Start mode resumes. When returning to the reels, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p><strong>Free Games</strong></p>
			<p>Wild symbols in any position on reels 2, 3 and 4 simultaneously, during the main game or during Free Games, win a cash prize of 10 times the total bet and trigger 15 Free Games with all wins tripled except for the Championship Bonus wins. The prize from the Scatter symbols that trigger the Bonus round is not tripled. If a combination of Wild symbols retriggers the Free Games round, the cash prize of 10 times the total bet is not tripled as well.</p>
			<p>To start the Free Games, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. A message appears saying that a Free Games round follows. After a short while, the Free Games begin automatically.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same number of lines and bets per line as on the spin that won the Free Games. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the main game spin that won the Free Games. <strong>Feature win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up).</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p>Free Game wins are added to the payline and Scatter wins.</p>
			<p>If the Free Games are triggered during the Auto Start mode, the feature begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. When all Free Games have been played and the player clicks <strong>Continue</strong> on the screen summarizing the Free Games win, the Auto Start mode resumes. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Gamble</strong></p>
			<p>A win activates the <strong>Gamble</strong> button which, when clicked, starts the Gamble feature where you can bet the winnings from your last spin to try and increase them.</p>
			<p>Your current winnings are shown in the <strong>Bank</strong> field. You can choose to bet these winnings to double them by clicking <strong>Red</strong> or <strong>Black</strong>button. <strong>Double To</strong> shows the amount that will be placed in the <strong>Bank</strong>, if you win.</p>
			<p>If you do not want to bet, you can click <strong>Collect</strong> to add the winnings from the last spin to your balance and return to the main game. If you choose to bet, you have to guess whether the next card that is going to be revealed is red or black. If your guess is correct, you win. If your guess is wrong, you lose your bet and the Gamble feature ends.</p>
			<p>With every win, you can bet again until the winnings in the <strong>Bank</strong> are equal to or greater than the Gamble feature limit. The limit is shown on the <strong>Info</strong> page that describes the Gamble feature.</p>
			<p>Click <strong>Collect</strong> to add your winnings to your balance and return to the main game.</p>
			<p><strong>Please note:</strong> The <strong>Gamble</strong> button is disabled during the Free Games feature and while the <strong>Auto Start</strong> is active.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 95.55%.</p>
