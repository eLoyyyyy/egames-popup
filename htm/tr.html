			<p><strong>3-Reel 5-Row Multispin Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The object of Tropic Reels is to obtain a winning symbol combination by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p>To play the game:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Choose the value of the coins you wish to wager each round, by clicking on the <strong>+</strong> and <strong>&ndash;</strong> buttons on the left of the screen.</li>
			<li>Click <strong>Bet One</strong> or <strong>Max Bet</strong> to select the number of coins you wish to wager. Each click on the <strong>Bet One</strong> button wagers one more coin. Pressing <strong>Max Bet</strong> increases your bet amount to the maximum amount possible &ndash; that is five coins &ndash; and spins the reels automatically. Remember that your total bet is five times the bet on one row. You can see your remaining credit, the bet amounts and win amount on the machine left of the reels.</li>
			<li>Click <strong>Spin</strong> (if you did not press <strong>Bet Max</strong>) to spin the reels.</li>
			<li>After the reels stop, select the reels you want to hold, by clicking on the <strong>Hold</strong> buttons beneath them or on the reels themselves. Click on <strong>Spin</strong> again to spin the reels you did not hold.</li>
			<li>If any of the rows show a winning combination after they stop, you win according to the winning table. Click the <strong>Paytable</strong>button to see the paytable, if you wish. Flip the pages with <strong>Next/Back</strong>, and close the paytable with <strong>Close</strong>. You can also click the Paytable button again to close the paytable.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>About the winning tables:</strong></p>
			<p>The tables show a winning amount for every symbol combination that deserves a win. The payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet. If you have winning combinations on multiple lines, add them all up to get the winning amount.</p>
			<p>The tiger with the word &ldquo;Wild&rdquo; written on it, is a wild symbol &ndash; meaning it stands for any other symbol, like a joker in card games.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> The three wild symbols pay 2500 x line bet only if you play for max bet. Otherwise they only pay 2000 x line bet.</p>
			<p><strong>Please note:</strong> There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much you're betting on a single payline. The total bet shows how much you're spending in this game round. The payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet, not by the total bet. If you get winning combinations on more than one payline, the winnings for each payline are added up.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 98.95%.</p>
