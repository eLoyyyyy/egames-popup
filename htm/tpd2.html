			<p><strong>5-Reel 15-line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Thai Paradise is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>A wagering denomination (coin value) can be chosen by clicking the <strong>Click to Change</strong> denomination button in the lower left-hand corner of the screen.</li>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking <strong>Bet per Line</strong>. Each click adds a coin to the line bet. When the maximum amount is reached (10 coins of the selected wagering denomination), clicking the button again resets the line bet to one coin.</li>
			<li>Paylines are chosen by clicking <strong>Lines</strong>. Each click activates a payline. When all paylines are activated, clicking the button again resets it to one active payline. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the maximum bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spin the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Start</strong> function. Clicking + or &ndash; above <strong>Auto Start</strong> selects the number of spins to be played automatically. Clicking <strong>Auto Start</strong> spins the reels for as many spins as displayed in <strong>Spins</strong> field above <strong>Auto Start</strong>. The<strong>Auto Start</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Start mode. The Auto Start mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the player clicks <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In the case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>A win activates the <strong>Gamble</strong> button which, when clicked, starts the Gamble feature. More information about the Gamble feature can be found below.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Free Games</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to trigger the Free Games feature and describes the Free Games feature rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Gamble</strong> screen describes how to try doubling winnings by gambling with them and describes the doubling-up rules.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Show Paylines</strong> opens a screen that illustrates all possible payline combinations. Clicking <strong>Hide Paylines</strong> closes this screen and returns to the <strong>Info</strong> screen.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels. Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking <strong>Lines</strong>.</li>
			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>If a symbol has a winning combination on more than one reel, the winnings are added up.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the leftmost reel, and the symbols have to be on consecutive reels.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbol <img src="../img/tpd2_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> appears both during the main game and the Free Games round. It does not have to occur on a particular payline. If there are 3 or more <img src="../img/tpd2_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> in the spin results, the payout earned is multiplied by the total bet and added to payline winnings.</p>
			<p><img src="../img/tpd2_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> can stand for any other symbol in the game, to make the best possible winning combination. It substitutes on any payline only when the payline contains any number of regular symbols that would win with the Scatter symbol(s) standing in. The payout earned in this way is the payout of the regular symbol as shown in the Paytable.</p>
			<p>No matter if they substitute any other symbols or not, 3 or more <img src="../img/tpd2_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> appearing anywhere on the reels pay out as Scatter symbols and trigger the Free Games round, as explained <a href="../img/tpd2.html#tpd2_freegames">here</a>.</p>
			<p><a name="tpd2_freegames"></a><strong>Free Games</strong></p>
			<p>Whenever 3 or more <img src="../img/tpd2_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> appear anywhere on the reels (even if they substitute other symbols), the player wins 10 Free Games with a Mystery Scatter.</p>
			<p>Whenever 3 <img src="../img/tpd2_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> simultaneously appear anywhere on the reels during the Free Games, 10 Free Games with the same Mystery Scatter symbol are added to the existing ones. In this way the Free Games can be indefinitely retriggered.</p>
			<p>To start the Free Games, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>.</p>
			<p>On the screen that appears next, all symbols are shuffled and one of them is randomly picked as a Mystery Scatter symbol during the Free Games that follow.</p>
			<p>The Mystery Scatter is different from the regular Scatter; it cannot be mixed with it to create shared combinations and cannot substitute for any other symbols. Like regular Scatter symbols, the Mystery Scatter symbols do not have to occur on a particular payline in order to form a win. The payouts for the Mystery Scatter will appear at the top of the Free Games reels.</p>
			<p>When 3 or more Mystery Scatter appear anywhere on the reels, they will expand to fill every position of the reels they are on after any payouts from line wins and standard Scatter wins have been awarded. This is a visual effect which does not add or reduce any winnings resulting from the spin. All active paylines will then pay the Mystery Scatter winning combinations, according to the payout of the original symbol. However, the payout is multiplied by the total bet of the spin that triggered the Free Games feature, rather than the line bet.</p>
			<p>The Scatter cannot substitute for the Mystery Scatter during the Free Games. The Mystery Scatter winnings are added to payline and regular Scatter winnings.</p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same number of lines and bets per line as on the spin that won the Free Games. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the main game spin that won the Free Games. <strong>Feature Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total Win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up).</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game.</p>
			<p>If the Free Games have been triggered during the Auto Start mode, the Free Games round begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. When all Free Games have been spun and the player clicks <strong>Continue</strong> on the screen summarizing the Free Games Win, the Auto Start mode resumes.</p>
			<p><strong>Gamble</strong></p>
			<p>A win activates the <strong>Gamble</strong> button which, when clicked, starts the Gamble feature where you can bet the winnings from your last spin to try and increase them.</p>
			<p>Your current winnings are shown in the <strong>Bank</strong> field. You can choose to bet these winnings to double them by clicking <strong>Red</strong> or <strong>Black</strong>button. <strong>Double To</strong> shows the amount that will be placed in the <strong>Bank</strong>, if you win.</p>
			<p>If you do not want to bet, you can click <strong>Collect</strong> to add the winnings from the last spin to your balance and return to the main game. If you choose to bet, you have to guess whether the next card that is going to be revealed is red or black. If your guess is correct, you win. If your guess is wrong, you lose your bet and the Gamble feature ends.</p>
			<p>With every win, you can bet again until the winnings in the <strong>Bank</strong> are equal to or greater than the Gamble feature limit. The limit is shown on the <strong>Info</strong> page that describes the Gamble feature.</p>
			<p>Click <strong>Collect</strong> to add your winnings from the <strong>Bank</strong> to your balance and return to the main game.</p>
			<p><strong>Please note:</strong> The <strong>Gamble</strong> button is disabled during Free Games and while the <strong>Auto Start</strong> is active.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 94.36%.</p>
