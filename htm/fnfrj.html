			<p><strong>Chain Reactor Game</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Funky Fruits is to obtain matching combinations of 5 or more vertically and/or horizontally adjacent symbols of the same kind to win a multiplier for the player&rsquo;s bet. There are 6 symbols to play with: <img src="../img/fnfrj_cherry.jpg" alt="" /> Cherry (Jackpot symbol), <img src="../img/fnfrj_lemon.jpg" alt="" />Lemon, <img src="../img/fnfrj_orange.jpg" alt="" /> Orange, <img src="../img/fnfrj_pineapple.jpg" alt="" /> Pineapple, <img src="../img/fnfrj_plum.jpg" alt="" /> Plum and <img src="../img/fnfrj_watermelon.jpg" alt="" /> Watermelon. The more symbols participate in the winning combination, the bigger the payout. 16 or more Lemon symbols will win the player up to 5,000 times his bet. Once a winning combination occurs and is paid, it explodes thus enabling more symbols to drop down and form new combinations.</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Select your bet per the game by clicking + and &ndash; adjacent to the <strong>Bet</strong> field. Note that balance is deducted by the bet amount upon entering the game. There are 4 fixed bet values that you can possibly choose from.</li>
			<li>Click <strong>Play</strong> at the bottom right corner of the game window to play the game.</li>
			<li>You can also play using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Use the + and &ndash; buttons at the sides of the Auto Play field to select the number of games to be played consecutively. The <strong>Play</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the game play. The active Auto Play session can be stopped by clicking the Stop button.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Win</strong> field displays the amount you have won in case of a winning combination.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Jackpot</strong> field displays the currently accumulated Jackpot sum according to the player&rsquo;s bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens a Paytable screen listing all winning combinations and their respective payouts. Clicking the <strong>Rules</strong> button at the bottom of the page opens a screen describing the game rules. Clicking <strong>OK</strong> sends you back to the Paytable page.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the Info screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Game Max Win Capping:</strong></p>
			<p>The maximum paytable prize applies to a single screen without any additional wins.</p>
			<p>The maximum prize per single bet applies to the maximum prize achieved by any win combination in a maximum of 100 consecutive screens.</p>
			<p><strong>Funky Fruits Progressive Jackpot</strong></p>
			<p>A winning combination of 8 to 25 Cherry symbols win the Jackpot, while the relative percentage of the Jackpot win is determined by the size of the player&rsquo;s bet:</p>
			<blockquote>&euro;1 bet wins 10% of the progressive jackpot.<br />&euro;2 bet wins 20% of the progressive jackpot.<br />&euro;5 bet wins 50% of the progressive jackpot.<br />&euro;10 bet wins 100% of the progressive jackpot.
			</blockquote>
			<p>The full jackpot can only be won if the player places the maximum possible bet in the game.</p>
			<p>1% of each player&rsquo;s bet in all Funky Fruits games played online in all online casinos, is added to the progressive jackpot in the following way: 0.5% will go towards the seed and 0.5% to the increment of the current jackpot. When the seed reaches 10,000 times the maximum possible total bet (configured by the casino operator), the percentage of the players&rsquo; bets stops feeding the seed and goes directly to the progressive part.</p>
			<p>The Jackpot ticker field is constantly updated according to the current player&rsquo;s bet.</p>
			<p>If two or more players win the jackpot at the same time, the wins are distributed as follows:</p>
			<blockquote>Player 1 places a bet that makes him eligible to win the progressive jackpot.<br />Players 2, 3, etc. will then only win the seed as the progressive part has already been won by Player 1.
			</blockquote>
			<p>If the game is terminated while winning the jackpot, a screen summarizing the jackpot winnings will be shown upon resuming the game. More information can be found in the <strong>Note on disconnections</strong> section at the bottom of this page.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 93.97%.</p>
