			<p><strong>5-reel 20-line slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Kong The Eighth Wonder of The World is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Line Bet</strong> to increase or decrease the amount.</li>
			<li>Paylines are chosen by clicking + or - below <strong>Lines</strong>. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the currently selected bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spins the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin results.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. <br />Roll over the <strong>Auto Play</strong> button to display the options: 10, 20, 30 or 50 spins. Clicking on any of them selects the successive number of spins to be enabled and spins the reels. The <strong>Auto Play</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Play mode. The Auto Play mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when you click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulated winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Jungle Mode Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations during Jungle Mode and appears only during Jungle Mode. The Jungle Mode and the Big City Mode are the only two modes of slot play. Their paytables have the same numbers for all symbols, but the symbols differ graphically. The other difference between the tables is the name of the bonus triggered by 3 or more Scatter symbols and the name of the playing mode activated when exiting that bonus. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Big City Mode Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations during Big City Mode and appears only during Big City Mode. The Jungle Mode and the Big City Mode are the only two modes of slot play. Their paytables have the same numbers for all symbols, but the symbols differ graphically. The other difference between the tables is the name of the bonus triggered by 3 or more Scatter symbols and the name of the playing mode activated when exiting that bonus. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Jungle Mode / Big City Mode</strong> screen explains that the game can be played in two modes: Jungle Mode and Big City Mode and describes what features can be triggered during each of the modes as well as how switching between the two modes is done.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Wild Jungle Respins</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to trigger the Wild Jungle Respins feature while in Jungle Mode and explains its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Skull Island Bonus</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to enter the Skull Island Bonus game while in Jungle Mode and describes the Skull Island Bonus game rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Wild Kong Respins</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to trigger the Wild Kong Respins feature while in Big City Mode and explains its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>City Tower Bonus</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to enter the City Tower Bonus game while in Big City Mode and describes the City Tower Bonus game rules.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Show Paylines</strong> on the <strong>Paytable</strong> page, opens a screen that illustrates all possible payline combinations. Clicking <strong>Hide Paylines</strong> closes this screen and returns to the <strong>Paytable</strong> page.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels. Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Lines</strong>.</li>
			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the left most reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Jungle Mode and Big City Mode</strong></p>
			<p>The game Kong The Eighth Wonder of The World is played in two modes: Jungle Mode and Big City Mode. In each of the two modes, the symbols change visually but the paytable remains the same. In Jungle Mode, the Wild Jungle Respins feature and the Skull Island Bonus can be triggered. In Big City Mode, the Wild Kong Respins feature and the City Tower Bonus can be triggered. Exiting Skull Island Bonus begins the Big City Mode, while exiting City Tower Bonus begins Jungle Mode.</p>
			<p>By default, the game begins in Jungle Mode.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol in the game is the <img src="../img/kkg_wild_jungle.jpg" alt="" /> symbol in Jungle Mode and <img src="../img/kkg_wild_city.jpg" alt="" /> in Big City Mode. The symbols pay the same in both modes and differ only graphically. Wild can stand for any other symbol, except Scatter, to make the best possible winning combination. There is also a separate payout for two or more Wild symbols on an active payline, as seen in the Paytable. This is paid out instead of the regular symbol win if the win amount from the Wild symbols is larger than the win from the regular symbols (by Wild standing in).</p>

Click on a location to uncover one out of three creatures or King Kong. Play until you uncover three of the same kind of creature or until you have found one King Kong. Each creature is worth a different cash prize which is a multiple of the total bet of the spin that triggered the Skull Island Bonus (X10, X15 or X20 for creatures or X30 for King Kong).

Once the clip is over, if there are any more selections to be made, the player is returned to the screen in which another plane must be picked. Taking down three planes ends the City Tower Bonus.
