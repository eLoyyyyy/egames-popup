			<p><strong>5-Reel 25-line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Wild Games is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Line Bet</strong> to increase or decrease the amount.</li>
			<li>Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Lines</strong>. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the currently selected bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spins the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Mouse over the <strong>Auto Play</strong> button to display the list of options. Select the number of spins to be played automatically or choose &lsquo;Until Feature&rsquo; to spin until a Bonus round is triggered. Clicking on an option starts the Auto Play function. The <strong>Auto Play</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Play mode. The Auto Play mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when a Bonus round is triggered if you chose &lsquo;Until Feature&rsquo;, or when you click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Freestyle Swim Bonus</strong> screen explains how to play and win in the Freestyle Swim Bonus game.</li>
			<li>The <strong>100m Dash Bonus</strong> screen explains the symbol combinations necessary to enter the Bonus round and describes its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Balance Beam Bonus</strong> screen describes the rules of the Balance Beam Bonus game.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Win a Medal Bonus</strong> screen describes how the Win a Medal Bonus game is played.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Paylines</strong> screen illustrates all possible payline combinations.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels. Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking + or &ndash; below <strong>Lines</strong>.</li>
			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the left most reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Maximum Win Limit</strong></p>
			<p>The maximum win in the game has an upper limit. For more information, see the Terms and Conditions section.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol <img src="../img/gtslgms_wild.jpg" alt="" /> can stand for any other symbol, except the 3 Bonus symbols ( <img src="../img/gtslgms_goldmedal.jpg" alt="" />, <img src="../img/gtslgms_silvermedal.jpg" alt="" /> and <img src="../img/gtslgms_bronzemedal.jpg" alt="" />), to make the best possible winning combination.</p>
			<p>There is also a separate payout for 2 or more Wild symbols on an active payline, as seen in the Paytable. This is paid out instead of the regular symbol win if the win amount from Wilds is larger than the win from the regular symbols (by Wild standing in).</p>
			<p><strong>Bonus Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>There are 3 Bonus symbols in the game: the Gold <img src="../img/gtslgms_goldmedal.jpg" alt="" />, Silver <img src="../img/gtslgms_silvermedal.jpg" alt="" /> and Bronze <img src="../img/gtslgms_bronzemedal.jpg" alt="" /> medals.

When they appear as stacked then 2 or 3 symbols respectively are shown 1 on top of the other. When 2 stacked symbols appear on reel #3 and participate in winning symbol combinations, they pay regularly and independently of one another as shown in the Paytable. When 3 stacked symbols appear on reel #3, each of them acts as a Wild symbol and can stand for any other symbol except the 3 Bonus symbols, to make the best possible winning combination. When 1 of the theme symbols covers reel #3 entirely, 1 of the following bonuses is triggered:</p>

			<p><strong>Note:</strong> during the Freestyle Swim Free Games there is a cap on the consecutive number of Free Games that can be additionally won. This means that if you have consecutively won 200 or more Free Games, including the original 8, you will be able to play them, but further retriggers will not be possible after you have crossed the 200th Free Game limit. Once you re-enter the Freestyle Swim Free Games, the consecutive Free Games count is back to 0. Thus you can consecutively win another 200 additional Free Games, including the original 8, the next time you enter the Freestyle Swim Free Games.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>During all Free Games modes, the reels are spun automatically using the same number of lines and bets per line as on the spin that won the Free Games. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the spin that won the free games. <strong>Feature win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total win</strong> shows the aggregate winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up).</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize. <strong>Free Game</strong> wins are added to the payline wins.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 95.24%.</p>
