			<p><strong>5-Reel 15-line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Safari Heat is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>A wagering denomination (coin value) can be chosen by clicking the <strong>Click to Change</strong> denomination button in the lower left-hand corner of the screen.</li>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking <strong>Bet per Line</strong>. Each click adds a coin to the line bet. When the maximum amount is reached (10 coins of the selected wagering denomination), clicking the button again resets the line bet to one coin.</li>
			<li>Paylines are chosen by clicking <strong>Lines</strong>. Each click activates a payline. When all paylines are activated, clicking the button again resets it to one active payline. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the currently selected bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spin the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Start</strong> function. Clicking + or &ndash; above <strong>Auto Start</strong> selects the successive number of spins to be enabled. Clicking <strong>Auto Start</strong> spins the reels. The <strong>Auto Start</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Start mode. The Auto Start mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the player clicks<strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are added up together.</li>
			<li>In the case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings.</li>
			<li>A win activates the <strong>Gamble</strong> button which, when clicked, starts the Gamble feature. More information about the Gamble feature can be found below.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Free Games</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to trigger the Free Games feature and describes the Free Games feature rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Gamble</strong> screen describes how to try doubling winnings by gambling with them and describes the doubling-up rules.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Show Paylines</strong> opens a screen that illustrates all possible payline combinations. Clicking <strong>Hide Paylines</strong> closes this screen and returns to the <strong>Info</strong> screen.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels. Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking <strong>Lines</strong>.</li>
			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line stake and the total stake. The line stake shows how much is being bet on a single win line. The total stake shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line stake.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>If a symbol has a winning combination on more than one reel, the winnings are added up.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the leftmost reel, and the symbols have to be on consecutive reels.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol <img src="../img/sfh_wild.jpg" alt="" /> appears both during the main game and the Free Games round. It can stand for any symbol other than <img src="../img/sfh_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> to make the best possible winning combination.</p>
			<p>Whenever <img src="../img/sfh_wild.jpg" alt="" /> takes part in a winning combination while substituting, it doubles the awarded win from that combination.</p>
			<p>There is also a separate payout for 2 or more <img src="../img/sfh_wild.jpg" alt="" /> on an active payline, as seen in the Paytable. This is paid out instead of the regular symbol win if the win amount from Wild is larger than the win from the regular symbols (by Wild standing in).</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Winning combinations made up entirely of Wild symbols will not be doubled by the effect of the Wild symbol.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Scatter Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols <img src="../img/sfh_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> do not have to occur on a particular payline. If there are 2 or more Scatter symbols in the spin results, the payout earned is multiplied by the total bet and added to payline winnings.</p>
			<p>If 3 or more <img src="../img/sfh_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> simultaneously appear anywhere on the reels, the Free Games round is triggered as explained below.</p>
			<p><strong>Free Games</strong></p>
			<p>Whenever 3 or more <img src="../img/sfh_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> simultaneously appear anywhere on the reels during the main game, 15 Free Games with a win multiplier of x3 are triggered.</p>
			<p>Whenever 3 or more <img src="../img/sfh_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> simultaneously appear anywhere on the reels during the Free Games, the Free Games round is retriggered, applying the same multiplier to any Free Games results. In this way you can retrigger the Free Games round indefinitely.</p>
			<p>To start the Free Games round click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>.</p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same number of lines and bets per line as on the spin that won the Free Games round. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the spin that won the Free Games. <strong>Feature Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total Win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up).</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize. Free Games Win is added to the payline and Scatter wins.</p>
			<p>If the Free Games have been triggered during the Auto Start mode, the Free Games round begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. When all Free Games have been played and the player clicks <strong>Continue</strong> on the screen summarizing the Free Games win, the Auto Start mode resumes. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p><strong>Gamble</strong></p>
			<p>A win activates the <strong>Gamble</strong> button which, when clicked, starts the Gamble feature where you can bet the winnings from your last spin to try and increase them.</p>
			<p>Your current winnings are shown in the <strong>Bank</strong> field. You can choose to bet these winnings to double them by clicking <strong>Red</strong> or <strong>Black</strong>button. <strong>Double To</strong> shows the amount that will be placed in the <strong>Bank</strong>, if you win.</p>
			<p>If you do not want to bet, you can click <strong>Collect</strong> to add the winnings from the last spin to your balance and return to the main game. If you choose to bet, you have to guess whether the next card that is going to be revealed is red or black. If your guess is correct, you win. If your guess is wrong, you lose your bet and the Gamble feature ends.</p>
			<p>With every win, you can bet again until the winnings in the <strong>Bank</strong> are equal to or greater than the Gamble feature limit. The limit is shown on the <strong>Info</strong> page that describes the Gamble feature.</p>
			<p>Click <strong>Collect</strong> to add your winnings from the <strong>Bank</strong> to your balance and return to the main game.</p>
			<p><strong>Please note:</strong> The <strong>Gamble</strong> button is disabled during Free Games and while the <strong>Auto Start</strong> is active.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 96.16%.</p>
