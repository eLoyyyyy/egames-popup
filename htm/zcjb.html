			<p><strong>5-reel 9-line slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Zhao Cai Jin Bao is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking + and - below <strong>Line Bet</strong> to increase or decrease the amount.</li>
			<li>Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Lines</strong>. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the currently selected bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spin the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Mouse over the <strong>Auto Play</strong> button to display the list of options. Select the number of spins to be played automatically. Clicking on an option starts the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. The <strong>Auto Play</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Play mode. The Auto Play mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when you click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Clicking the <strong>Turbo Mode</strong> button switches on or off the Turbo Mode thus turning on or off some of the win animations and sounds, and making the reels spin faster or slower.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In the case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Paylines</strong> screen illustrates all possible payline combinations and explains the payout rules in the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels as illustrated in the <strong>Paylines</strong> screen of the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			</ul>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Winning combinations on active paylines pay both directions: from left to right and from right to left.</li>
			<li>If there are multiple simultaneous wins in either direction, the highest paying winning combination in each direction counts.</li>
			<li>One and the same active payline can pay twice after a single spin. However, 5-of-a-kind wins are paid only once.</li>
			<li>Left to right winning combinations must start from the leftmost reel and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			<li>Right to left winning combinations must start from the rightmost reel and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			<li>If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are added up.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol <img src="../img/zcjb_wild.jpg" alt="" /> appears on reels #2, #3, and #4. It can stand for any other symbol, including <img src="../img/zcjb_scatter.jpg" alt="" />, to make the best possible winning combination.</p>
			<p>Wild combinations do not pay separately.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> Whenever <img src="../img/zcjb_wild.jpg" alt="" /> participates in a winning combination along an active payline, it doubles the payout, but does not accumulate it. This means that the win will be multiplied x2 regardless of the number of Wild symbols substituting in the winning combination.</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>Scatter symbols <img src="../img/zcjb_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> do not have to occur on any particular payline. If 2 or more Scatter symbols appear in the reel-spin results, the payout earned is multiplied by the total bet and added to payline winnings, if any.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> Winning Scatter combinations pay only if they start from the leftmost or rightmost reel respectively and <img src="../img/zcjb_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> are consecutive.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 95.99%.</p>
