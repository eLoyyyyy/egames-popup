			<p><strong>5-Reel 15-line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Top Trumps World Football Stars is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>A wagering denomination (coin value) can be chosen by clicking the <strong>Click to Change</strong> denomination button in the lower left-hand corner of the screen.</li>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking <strong>Bet per Line</strong>. Each click adds a coin to the line bet. When the maximum amount is reached (10 coins of the selected wagering denomination), clicking the button again resets the line bet to one coin.</li>
			<li>Paylines are chosen by clicking <strong>Lines</strong>. Each click activates a payline. When all paylines are activated, clicking the button again resets it to one active payline. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the maximum bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spins the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Start</strong> function. Clicking + or &ndash; above <strong>Auto Start</strong> selects the successive number of spins to be enabled. Clicking <strong>Auto Start</strong> spins the reels. The <strong>Auto Start</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Start mode of reelspin. The Auto Start mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the player clicks <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>Simultaneous winnings on different paylines are added up together.</li>
			<li>In the case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			<li>A win activates the <strong>Gamble</strong> button which, when clicked, starts the Gamble feature. More information about the Gamble feature can be found below.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p></p>

			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>

			<li>Winning combinations must start from the left most or right most reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Choose Your Teams Feature</strong></p>
			<p>Top Trumps World Football Stars has a special feature, which allows you to choose the images that appear on the reels. These images must be chosen when entering the game and can be changed at any time during the main game, when the reels are not spinning and when not in Auto Start mode. The images on the screen are automatically updated. In addition, the Paytable page and the Info pages are also updated according to your choice. <br />These choices do not influence the sum of a winning combination, but only the images that appear on the screen.</p>
			<p>When entering the game for the first time, you must choose 2 teams before being able to see the reels. When re-entering the game, you may choose 2 new teams or simply continue to the reels. <br />You have to choose two of the following teams to play with: Argentina, Brazil, England, France, Germany, Italy or Spain. Three players from each team will appear on the reels. <br />Click on a team to make a selection and then click Continue to see the reels. You can change both teams at any time during the main game, using the <strong>Change Team</strong> buttons above the reels. </p>
			<p><strong>Lines Pay Both Ways</strong></p>
			<p>The symbols from the first team (represented on the left, when making a choice of teams) pay left to right, when appearing on an active payline and on adjacent reels, starting with the leftmost reel. The symbols from the second team (represented on the right, when making a choice of teams) pay right to left, when appearing on an active payline and adjacent reels, starting with the rightmost reel. The Royal symbols pay in both directions in the main game and during the Free Games feature. One payline can pay in both directions simultaneously. The player will get the highest win in each direction, using 5 of a kind only once. <br />During the Free Games feature, all lines pay in both directions simultaneously. The player will get the highest win in each direction, using 5 of a kind only once. </p>
			<p><strong>Wild symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol in the game is the <img src="../img/tfs_wild.jpg" alt="" /> symbol. It can stand for any other symbol, except Scatter, either of the Flag symbols, or the Ball, to make the best possible winning combination. There is also a separate payout for two or more Wild symbols on an active payline, as seen in the Paytable. This is paid out instead of the regular symbol win if the win amount from Wilds is larger than the win from the regular symbols (by Wild standing in). The Wild symbol does not substitute in Mixed Pay combinations.</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols <img src="../img/tfs_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> do not have to occur on any particular payline. If there are two or more Scatters in the spin results, the payout earned is multiplied by the total bet and added to payline winnings.</p>
			<p><strong>Pass the Ball Bonus</strong></p>
			<p>The Ball symbol <img src="../img/tfs_bonus.jpg" alt="" /> appears only on reels #2 and #4 during the main game. All Flag symbols appear only on reels #1 and #5 during the main game. <br />If the Ball symbol appears on reel #2 with a left-side team member (represented on the left, when making a choice of teams) on its immediate left on reel #1, the ball will be passed among all of his team members appearing on the reels. For every player that touches the ball, 3 times the total bet is won. <br />If the Ball symbol appears on reel #4 with a right-side team member (represented on the right, when making a choice of teams) on its immediate right on reel #5, the ball will be passed among all of his team members appearing on the reels. For every player that touches the ball, 3 times the total bet is paid. <br />The Pass the Ball Bonus can be triggered only during the main game.</p>
			<p><strong>Mixed Pay feature</strong></p>
			<p>A mixed combination is any combination of players from the same team that are not all the same symbol. These players must appear on an active payline and on adjacent reels, beginning with either the leftmost or rightmost reel, as explained below. <br />During main game, mixed combinations of the first team pay left to right and must begin on the leftmost reel, while mixed combinations from the second team pay right to left and must begin on the rightmost reel. <br />During Free Games, mixed combinations pay both left to right and right to left. <br />For both teams, only mixed combinations of at least 3 symbols can win. The Wild symbol does not participate in mixed pay combinations. </p>
			<p><strong>Free games</strong></p>
			<p>Flag symbols of the same team on both reels #1 and #5 win 12 Free Games. Players of the opposite team will not appear on the reels during Free Games. More player icons of the triggering team will be added to the reels.</p>
			<p>Paylines pay in both directions for all symbols, including mixed pay combinations.</p>
			<p>To start the Free Games, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. Next, a message is displayed, explaining that 12 Free Games have been won. Click Continue and the Free Games begin automatically.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same number of lines and bets per line as on the spin that won the Free Games. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the spin that won the free games. <strong>Feature win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total win</strong> shows the aggregate winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up).</p>
			<p>The Ball and Flag symbols do not appear during Free Games. More Free Games cannot be retriggered.</p>
			<p>Free Game wins are added to the payline and Scatter wins.</p>
			<p>If the Free Games are triggered during the Auto Start mode, the feature begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. When all Free Games have been played and the player clicks <strong>Continue</strong> on the screen summarizing the Free Games win, the Auto Start mode resumes.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Gamble</strong></p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>A win activates the <strong>Gamble</strong> button which, when clicked, starts the Gamble feature where you can bet the winnings from your last spin to try and increase them.</p>
			<p>Your current winnings are shown in the <strong>Bank</strong> field. You can choose to bet these winnings (<strong>Double</strong> button) to double them. <strong>Double To</strong>shows the amount that will be placed in the <strong>Bank</strong>, if you win. <br />You can also choose to bet only half your current winnings (<strong>Double Half</strong> button) and keep the other half in the <strong>Bank</strong>. <strong>Double Half To</strong>shows the amount that will be placed in the <strong>Bank</strong> (includes the amount that remained in the <strong>Bank</strong>), if you win.<br /><strong>Bet</strong> will show your bet in the Gamble round.</p>
			<p>If you do not want to bet, you can click <strong>Collect</strong> to add the winnings from the last spin to your balance and return to the main game. If you choose to bet, the dealer&rsquo;s card is revealed on the left-hand side of the screen and you have to pick a card from the remaining face-down cards. If you pick a card with a higher ranking than the dealer&rsquo;s card, you win. If your card is equal in ranking, the bet is returned. If your card is lower in ranking than the dealer&rsquo;s card, you lose your bet and the Gamble feature ends.</p>
			<p>With every win, you can bet again until the winnings in the <strong>Bank</strong> are equal to or greater than the Gamble feature limit. The limit is shown on the <strong>Info</strong> page that describes the Gamble feature.</p>
			<p>Click <strong>Collect</strong> to add your winnings from the <strong>Bank</strong> to your balance and return to the main game.</p>
			<p><strong>Please note:</strong> The <strong>Gamble</strong> button is disabled during free spins and while the <strong>Auto Start</strong> is active.</p>
