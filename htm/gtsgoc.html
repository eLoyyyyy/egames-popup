			<p><strong>5-Reel 20-line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The object of Ghosts of Christmas is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Line Bet</strong> to increase or decrease the amount.</li>
			<li>Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Lines</strong>. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the currently selected bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spins the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Mouse over the <strong>Auto Play</strong> button to display the list of options. Select the number of spins to be played automatically or choose &lsquo;Until Feature&rsquo; to spin until the Ghosts of Christmas Bonus or Marley's Free Games round is triggered. Clicking on an option starts the Auto Play function. The <strong>Auto Play</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Play mode. The Auto Play mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the Ghosts of Christmas Bonus or Marley's Free Games round is triggered if you chose &lsquo;Until Feature&rsquo;, or when you click<strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In the case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			</ul>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Marley's Free Games</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to trigger the Free Games feature and describes its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Ghosts of Christmas Bonus</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to enter the bonus round and explains its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Paylines</strong> screen illustrates all possible paylines and explains the rules for calculating their wins.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels. Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking + or &ndash; below <strong>Lines</strong>.</li>
			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the left most reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Maximum Win Limit</strong></p>
			<p>The maximum win in the game has an upper limit. For more information, see the Terms and Conditions section.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol <img src="../img/gtsgoc_wild.jpg" alt="" /> can stand for any other symbol, except for Bonus and Scatter, to make the best possible winning combination. There is also a separate payout for 2 or more Wild symbols on an active payline, as seen in the Paytable. This is paid out instead of the regular symbol win if the win amount from Wilds is larger than the win from the regular symbols (by Wild standing in).</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols <img src="../img/gtsgoc_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> do not have to occur on any particular payline. If there are 2 or more Scatters in any position in the spin results, the payout is multiplied by the total bet and added to the payline winnings, if any.</p>
			<p>If 3 or more Scatter symbols appear simultaneously anywhere on the reels during the main game, Marley's Free Games round is triggered.</p>
			<p>If 3 or more Scatter symbols appear simultaneously anywhere on the reels during the Free Games round, 10 more Free Games are won. More information on the Free Games can be found <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>Bonus symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Bonus symbol in the game is <img src="../img/gtsgoc_bonus.jpg" alt="" />.</p>
			<p>If 3 or more Bonus symbols appear consecutively on an active payline, starting from the leftmost reel, the Ghosts of Christmas Bonus round is triggered. More information on the Ghosts of Christmas Bonus can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Ghosts of Christmas Bonus</strong></p>
			<p>To start the Ghosts of Christmas Bonus, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong> in the lower right-hand corner of the game window.</p>
			<p>During the bonus round the player picks objects to win cash prizes. The number of objects that will be picked equals the number of <img src="../img/gtsgoc_bonus.jpg" alt="" /> symbols that have triggered the bonus round. For example, if the bonus has been triggered by 3 <img src="../img/gtsgoc_bonus.jpg" alt="" /> symbols, the player will choose 3 objects, etc.</p>
			<p>The Ghosts of Christmas Bonus round has three themes, one of which is chosen randomly each time the bonus is triggered. The themes differ only visually and do not affect the rules or wins of the round. These are Christmas Past, Christmas Present and Christmas Future, where the player needs to choose desks, gifts or headstones, respectively.</p>
			<p>At the end of the Ghosts of Christmas Bonus round, a win screen displays your winnings. <strong>Game Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the main game or free game spin that won the Bonus. <strong>Feature Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Bonus. <strong>Total Win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up). If no winnings were received during the spin that won the Bonus, then only the <strong>Total Win</strong> field will be shown. Click <strong>Continue</strong> to return to the main game reels.</p>
			<p>If the Ghosts of Christmas Bonus is triggered during the Auto Play mode, the feature begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. The player then needs to make selections. When the Ghosts of Christmas Bonus is over and the player clicks <strong>Continue</strong> on the screen summarizing the Bonus win, the Auto Play mode resumes. When returning to the main game reels, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
