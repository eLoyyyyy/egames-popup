			<p><strong>5-reel 50-line slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Piggies and the Wolf is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Line Bet</strong> to increase or decrease the amount.</li>
			<li>The Piggies and the Wolf game is always played with 50 active paylines. The number of active paylines is fixed and cannot be changed by the player.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spins the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin results.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Mouse over the <strong>Auto Play</strong> button to display the list of options. Select the number of spins to be played automatically or choose <strong>Until Feature</strong> to spin until the Free Games or the Blow the House down Bonus round is triggered. Clicking on an option starts the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. The <strong>Auto Play</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Play mode. The Auto Play mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the Free Games or the Blow the House down Bonus round is triggered if you chose <strong>Until Feature</strong>, or when you click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Clicking the <strong>Turbo Mode</strong> button switches on or off the Turbo Mode thus turning on or off some of the win animations and sounds, and making the reels spin faster or slower.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			</ul>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Huff N&rsquo; Puff Shuffle Feature</strong> screen describes how the feature is triggered and what its rules are.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Free Games</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to trigger the Free Games feature and describes the Free Games feature rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Blow the House down Bonus</strong> screen explains the symbol combinations necessary to enter the Bonus round and how it is played.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Paylines</strong> screen illustrates all possible payline combinations and explains the payout rules in the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels as illustrated on the <strong>Paylines</strong> screen of the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>All 50 active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the left most reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol <img src="../img/paw_wild.jpg" alt="" /> can stand for any other symbol, except <img src="../img/paw_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> and <img src="../img/paw_bonus.jpg" alt="" />, to make the best possible winning combination and appears both during main game and Free Games.</p>
			<p>There is also a separate payout for 5 Wild symbols on an active payline, as seen in the Paytable.</p>
			<p><img src="../img/paw_wild.jpg" alt="" /> can appear as stacked on reels #1, #3 and #5 as explained <a href="../img/paw.html#pawSTACKED">here</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols <img src="../img/paw_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> appear on reels #1, #3 and #5 during both main and Free Games round. They do not have to occur on any particular payline.</p>
			<p>If 3 <img src="../img/paw_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> appear in any position on these reels during main game, the payout earned is multiplied by the total bet and added to payline winnings, if any. In addition, 15 Free Games are triggered as explained <a href="../img/paw.html#pawFG">here</a>.</p>
			<p>If 3 <img src="../img/paw_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> appear in any position on reels #1, #3 and #5 simultaneously during Free Games, the Free Games round is retriggered.</p>
			<p><strong>Bonus Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Bonus symbol <img src="../img/paw_bonus.jpg" alt="" /> appears on reels #1, #3 and #5 during main game only. If 3 <img src="../img/paw_bonus.jpg" alt="" /> appear in any position on reels #1, #3 and #5 simultaneously, the Blow the House down Bonus is triggered as explained <a href="../img/paw.html#pawBONUS">here</a>.</p>
			<p><a name="pawSTACKED"></a><strong>Stacked Wilds</strong></p>
			<p><img src="../img/paw_wild.jpg" alt="" /> can appear as stacked on reels #1, #3 and #5, and is non-stacked on reels #2 and #4. When stacked, 2, 3, or 4 <img src="../img/paw_wild.jpg" alt="" /> are shown 1 on top of the other. All positions covered by stacked and non-stacked Wilds on the reels act as Wild.</p>
			<p>Whenever <img src="../img/paw_wild.jpg" alt="" /> appears as stacked and covering all 4 positions on reel #5, the Huff N&rsquo; Puff Shuffle Feature is triggered as explained below.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> Stacked Wilds are available during main game only.</p>
			<p><strong>Huff N&rsquo; Puff Shuffle Feature</strong></p>
			<p>The Huff N&rsquo; Puff Shuffle Feature is triggered by the appearance of <img src="../img/paw_wild.jpg" alt="" /> stacked entirely on reel #5.</p>
			<p>On the screen that follows Wolf appears on his motorbike. He huffs and puffs at the symbols on the reels. All symbols, including the Stacked Wilds that have won the feature, get shuffled and re-arrange on the reels. All resulting winning combinations, if any, pay according to the Paytable and their payout is added to the current win.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Huff N&rsquo; Puff Shuffle Feature is available during main game only and cannot be retriggered. If 4 Wild symbols re-appear on reel 5 after the wilds are re-distributed- the feature will not re-trigger. Neither the Blow the House down Bonus, nor the Free Games round can be triggered during the Huff N&rsquo; Puff Shuffle Feature.</p>
			<p><a name="pawBONUS"></a><strong>Blow the House down Bonus</strong></p>
			<p>The Blow the House down Bonus can be triggered during main game only by the simultaneous appearance of 3 <img src="../img/paw_bonus.jpg" alt="" /> anywhere on reels #1, #3 and #5.</p>
			<p>To start the Blow the House down Bonus, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>.</p>
			<p>During the whole Bonus round you need to help Wolf to completely blow down the houses of the 3 pigs, one at a time, starting from the straw house, then the stick house and finally, the brick one to win the big Bonus cash prize.</p>
			<p>Each time the Bad Wolf tries to blow a house down, whether it is the straw, the stick or the brick one, a cash prize is awarded:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>-&gt; Each attempt of the Bad Wolf, either successful or not, to blow down the straw house, will award a cash prize equal to a random multiplier of x2, x3, or x4 by the total bet.</li>
			<li>-&gt; Each attempt of the Bad Wolf, either successful or not, to blow down the stick house, will award a cash prize equal to a random multiplier of x4, x5, or x6 by the total bet.</li>
			<li>-&gt; The attempt of the Bad Wolf, either successful or not, to blow down the brick house, will award a cash prize equal to a random multiplier of x8, x9, x10, x11, x13, x14, x15, x20, x50, or x100 by the total bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>At the beginning of the Blow the House down Bonus Wolf appears in front of the straw house of the 1st pig. 3 symbols are displayed on the screen. Choose 1 of the following symbols - <img src="../img/paw_bonus1.jpg" alt="" />, <img src="../img/paw_bonus2.jpg" alt="" />, or <img src="../img/paw_bonus3.jpg" alt="" />, to watch Wolf do a dance that may, or may not, help him blow the house down.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> Only 1 of the 3 moves will be successful. The one that will blow the house down completely will be different each time you enter the Bonus round and for each of the first 2 houses to be knocked down. For example, the move that destroyed the straw house may, or may not, destroy the sticks house.</p>
			<p>Click <strong>OK</strong> and choose your manoeuvre by clicking on the respective symbol.</p>
			<p>In case the 1st move succeeds and the house gets completely destroyed, the 1st pig runs to the sticks house of the 2nd one. If the 1st move does not succeed, pick another out of the remaining 2. In case the 2nd move does not knock the house down completely, the Bonus round ends.</p>
			<p>If the straw house gets completely destroyed, Wolf goes to the sticks house of the 2nd pig. Pick again one of the 3 symbols to choose the move. In case the 1st move succeeds and the house gets blown down, both pigs run to the brick house of the 3rd pig. If the 1st move does not succeed, pick another out of the remaining 2. In case the 2nd move does not knock the house down completely, the Bonus round ends.</p>
			<p>If the sticks house gets completely destroyed, Wolf arrives on his motorbike to the brick house of the 3rd and last pig. This time you can pick a symbol just once by clicking on any of the 3 that appear: <img src="../img/paw_bonus3_1.jpg" alt="" />, <img src="../img/paw_bonus3_2.jpg" alt="" />, or <img src="../img/paw_bonus3_3.jpg" alt="" />. Each symbol boosts Wolf&rsquo;s bike so that he can try and destroy the house completely. If Wolf succeeds, you get the big bonus cash award. If Wolf fails, the Blow the House down Bonus ends.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> During the Blow the House down Bonus round each symbol you pick awards a random amount of cash, the one standing for a successful result always winning the highest. The more houses you completely knock down, the more the cash awarded.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> Neither the Huff N&rsquo; Puff Shuffle Feature, nor the Free Games round can be triggered during the reel spin that triggered the Blow the House down Bonus round.</p>
			<p>At the end of the Bonus game, a win screen displays your winnings. <strong>Game Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the main game that won the Bonus. <strong>Feature Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Bonus. <strong>Total Win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up). If no winnings were received during the spin that won the Bonus, then only the <strong>Total Win</strong> field will be shown.</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game.</p>
			<p><a name="pawFG"></a><strong>Free Games</strong></p>
			<p>Whenever 3 <img src="../img/paw_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> appear anywhere on reels #1, #3 and #5 during main game, 15 Free Games with the Pigs Running Wild Feature are triggered.</p>
			<p>Click on <strong>Continue</strong> for the Free Games round to begin.</p>
			<p>Whenever <img src="../img/paw_wild.jpg" alt="" /> appears to the immediate right of <img src="../img/paw_pig1.jpg" alt="" />, <img src="../img/paw_pig2.jpg" alt="" />, or <img src="../img/paw_pig3.jpg" alt="" />, the Pigs Running Wild Feature is triggered. Wolf will chase the pig from right to left. All positions along the same horizontal line through which they run will become Wild, including the position Wolf had occupied upon triggering the feature. All resulting winning combinations pay according to the Paytable.</p>
			<p>15 Free Games will be retriggered whenever 3 <img src="../img/paw_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> appear in any position on reels #1, #3 and #5 simultaneously during the Free Games round.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> The payout from the spin that triggered the Pigs Running Wild Feature, if any, will pay before the payout of the feature itself pays off.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong>field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the spin that won the Free Games. <strong>Feature Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total Win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up).</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize. Free Games wins are added to the payline and Scatter wins.</p>
			<p>If the Free Games have been triggered during the Auto Play mode, the Free Games round begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. When all Free Games have been played and the player clicks <strong>Continue</strong> on the screen summarizing the Free Games win, the Auto Play mode resumes. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 92.10%.</p>
