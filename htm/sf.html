			<p><strong>3-Reel Max Bet 2 Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The object of Sultan's Fortune is to obtain a winning symbol combination by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Any 3&rdquo; means getting a symbol on all three reels. Sometimes the reel stops with the payline between the symbols, in that case you do not have &ldquo;Any 3&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>Sultan's Fortune has a wild symbol &ndash; the hat and wand. It stands for any other symbol (like a joker in some card games). If there is a wild symbol in a winning combination, the winning is multiplied by 2, two wild symbols multiply the win by 4.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Choose the value of the coins you wish to wager each round, by clicking on the <strong>+</strong> and <strong>&ndash;</strong> buttons on the left of the screen.</li>
			<li>Click <strong>Bet One</strong> or <strong>Bet Max</strong> to select the number of coins you wish to wager. Click <strong>Bet One</strong> to bet one coin, or <strong>Bet Max</strong> to bet two coins and spin the reels automatically.</li>
			<li>You can also bet by clicking on the corresponding column in the paytable (the left column bets one coin, the right column bets two coins). The reels will start to spin automatically.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> increases your bet to the maximum &ndash; that is, two coins &ndash; and spins the reels automatically.</li>
			<li>Click <strong>Spin</strong> (if you did not press <strong>Bet Max</strong> or use the paytable), or click on the arm, to spin the reels.</li>
			<li>If the reels show a winning combination after they stop (along the payline), you win according to the paytable.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>Please note:</strong> There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much you're betting on a single payline. The total bet shows how much you're spending in this game round.&nbsp;The payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the coin size, not the line bet. If you get winning combinations on more than one payline, the winnings for each payline are added up.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 97.26%.</p>
