			<p>Rubik's Riches is like a three-dimensional slot game, only instead of spinning reels, the Rubik's Cube is spinning. The objective of the game is to get as many lines or faces of the Rubik's Cube as possible. Three squares of the same color in a straight line (either horizontal or vertical) on the same side of the cube count as one line. If all the squares on one side of the cube are the same color, the face payout will also be awarded. Only three faces of the cube are shown and used for the payouts.</p>

			<h4>To play the game:</h4>
			
			<ul>
				<li><p>Click the Bet + and Bet - buttons to place the bet. If you change your bet, the line payouts on the left side of the screen and the face payouts in the upper right area of the screen change respectively. The total bet is shown in the Total Bet box in the lower right area of the screen.</p></li>
				<li><p>Click Play to start the game. The Rubik's Cube starts to spin randomly.</p></li>
				<li><p>When the Rubik's Cube stops and shows the winning combinations, the line payouts and face payouts are accumulated and your total win is shown in the Win box in the lower right area of the screen.</p></li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Bonus Round</h4>
			<p>If all six letters of the Rubikâ€™s logo are lit up during the spin, the bonus round is activated. You can either choose which stickers to peel off or click Peel and the stickers will be chosen randomly. Peeling off stickers awards Freeplays or up to eight extra cubes. You can choose the stickers until a peeled sticker says Start.</p>

			<h4>Freeplays</h4>

			<p>Clicking Start after the Bonus Round automatically starts Freeplays. Freeplays use the same bet as the game that triggered the freeplays. If all six letters of the Rubik's logo are lit up during the Freeplays mode, a popup appears saying that you have won additional Freeplays or extra cubes. When the Freeplays are completed, a popup shows your total winnings during the Freeplays round.</p>

			<h4>Autoplay</h4>

			<p>Click on Auto Play and select the number of game rounds to be played consecutively. Clicking Play starts the Autoplay function. A popup shows how many Autoplay sessions are left as well as displaying the Stop Autoplay button after each Autoplay round. The active Autoplay session can be stopped by clicking Stop Autoplay.</p>

			<h4>Additional settings:</h4>

			<ul>
				<li><p>Clicking on Turbo Mode in the lower left area of the screen reduces the animations, displaying the final results faster. Clicking Turbo Mode again returns you to the regular game mode.</p></li>
				<li><p>There are two different sets of audio available in the game. You can change it by clicking Change Audio button in the lower left area of the screen.</p></li>
			</ul>
			
			<h4>Return to Player</h4>

			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 94.50%.</p>
