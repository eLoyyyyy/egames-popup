			<p><strong>3-Reel 10-Row Multispin Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The object of Ugga Bugga is to obtain a winning symbol combination by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p>To play the game:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Choose the value of the coins you wish to wager each round, by clicking on the <strong>+</strong> and <strong>&ndash;</strong> buttons on the left of the screen.</li>
			<li>Click <strong>Bet One</strong> or <strong>Max Bet</strong> to select the number of coins you wish to wager. Each click on the <strong>Bet One</strong> button wagers one more coin. Pressing <strong>Max Bet</strong> increases your bet amount to the maximum amount possible &ndash; that is five coins &ndash; and spins the reels automatically. Remember that your total bet is ten times the bet on one row. You can see your remaining credit, the bet amounts and win amount on the machine left of the reels.</li>
			<li>Click <strong>Spin</strong> (if you did not press <strong>Bet Max</strong>) to spin the reels.</li>
			<li>After the reels stop, select the reels you want to hold, by clicking on the <strong>Hold</strong> buttons beneath them or on the reels themselves. Click on <strong>Spin</strong> again to spin the reels you did not hold.</li>
			<li>If any of the rows show a winning combination after they stop, you win according to the winning table. Click the <strong>Paytable</strong>button to see the paytable, if you wish. You can also click the Paytable button again to close the paytable.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>About the winning tables:</strong></p>
			<p>The tables show a winning amount for every symbol combination that deserves a win. The payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet. If you have winning combinations on multiple lines, add them all up to get the winning amount.</p>
			<p>The wild symbol can stand for any other symbol, like a joker in card games.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> The three wild symbols pay 1000 x line bet only if you play for max bet. Otherwise they only pay 250 x line bet.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 99.07%.</p>
