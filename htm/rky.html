			<p><strong>5-Reel 25-line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Rocky is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>A wagering denomination (coin value) can be chosen by clicking the <strong>Click to Change</strong> denomination button in the lower left-hand corner of the screen.</li>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking <strong>Bet per Line</strong>. Each click adds a coin to the line bet. When the maximum amount is reached (10 coins of the selected wagering denomination), clicking the button again resets the line bet to one coin.</li>
			<li>Paylines are chosen by clicking <strong>Lines</strong>. Each click activates a payline. When all paylines are activated, clicking the button again resets it to one active payline. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the maximum bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spins the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Start</strong> function. Clicking + or &ndash; above <strong>Auto Start</strong> selects the successive number of spins to be enabled. Clicking <strong>Auto Start</strong> spins the reels. The <strong>Auto Start</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Start mode of reelspin. The Auto Start mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the player clicks <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In the case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>A win activates the <strong>Gamble</strong> button which, when clicked, starts the Gamble feature. More information about the Gamble feature can be found below.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Knockout Bonus</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to trigger the Bonus game and describes the Bonus round rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Free Games</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to trigger the Free Games feature and describes the Free Games feature rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Rocky</strong> screen explains how the Rocky feature is won.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Gamble</strong> screen describes how to try doubling winnings by gambling with them and describes the doubling-up rules.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Show Paylines</strong> on the <strong>Paytable</strong> page, opens a screen that illustrates all possible payline combinations. Clicking <strong>Hide Paylines</strong> closes this screen and returns to the <strong>Paytable</strong> page.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels. Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking <strong>Lines</strong>.</li>
			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the left most reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol in the game is the <img src="../img/rky_wild.jpg" alt="" /> symbol. It can stand for any other symbol, except Scatter and Bonus, to make the best possible winning combination. There is also a separate payout for 3 or more Wild symbols on an active payline, as seen in the Paytable. This is paid out instead of the regular symbol win if the win amount from Wilds is larger than the win from the regular symbols (by Wild standing in).<br />The Wild symbol does not substitute to spell &ldquo;ROCKY&rdquo;.</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbol in the game is the <img src="../img/rky_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> symbol. The Scatter symbols do not have to occur on any particular payline. If there are 2 or more Scatters in the spin results, the payout earned is multiplied by the total bet and added to payline winnings. If 3, 4 or 5 Scatter symbols appear anywhere on the reels simultaneously, 15, 20 or 25 Free Games are won respectively. All wins during Free Games are doubled, including the Rocky feature wins.</p>
			<p>To start the Free Games, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. The reels are then replaced by a scene from the movie &lsquo;Rocky&rsquo;. At the end of the screen, the numbers of Free Games won appears. After a short pause, the Free Games start automatically.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same number of lines and bets per line as on the spin that won the Free Games. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the spin that won the free games. <strong>Feature win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total win</strong> shows the aggregate winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up).</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the regular slot reels.</p>
			<p>During Free Games, more Wild symbols are added on the reels. If 3 or more Scatters appear anywhere on the reels during Free Games, 15 additional Free Games with the same multiplier are added to the existing ones. Free Game wins are added to the payline and Scatter wins.</p>
			<p>If the Free Games are triggered during the Auto Start mode, the feature begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. When all Free Games have been played, the win screen is displayed. After the player clicks <strong>Continue</strong>, the Auto Start mode resumes.</p>
			<p><strong>Bonus symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Bonus symbols in the game are the <img src="../img/rky_bonus1.jpg" alt="" /> and <img src="../img/rky_bonus2.jpg" alt="" /> symbols. The white glove appears only on reel #1 while the red glove appears only on reel #5. If after a spin both gloves appear simultaneously anywhere on their respective reels, an animation is played and the Knockout Bonus is triggered.</p>
			<p>To start the Knockout Bonus round, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. A screen appears, asking you to choose one of three of Rocky&rsquo;s most famous opponents. Once chosen, the screen will change to a ring in which ten bonus rounds will be played. Rocky and the chosen opponent will fight in the middle of the screen, with videos from the movie, for ten short rounds. For every round won by Rocky, three times the total bet of the spin that triggered the Knockout Bonus is awarded. All matches end with a knockout in Rocky&rsquo;s favour. If a knockout occurs earlier than the 10th round, all following rounds are considered to be won by Rocky. Once the match is over, a win screen appears, displaying your total bonus win. After a short pause, the game resumes automatically.</p>
			<p>The Knockout Bonus cannot be triggered during the Free Games.</p>
			<p>The Knockout Bonus wins are added to the payline and Scatter wins.</p>
			<p>If the Knockout Bonus round and the Free Games are triggered during the same spin, the Knockout Bonus round will be played first.</p>
			<p><strong>Rocky Feature</strong></p>
			<p>If the letters &ldquo;R&rdquo;, &ldquo;O&rdquo;, &ldquo;C&rdquo;, &ldquo;K&rdquo;, &ldquo;Y&rdquo; appear in this order, from left to right, on consecutive reels, regardless of paylines, five times the total bet is awarded. The Wild symbol does not substitute to spell &ldquo;ROCKY&rdquo;.</p>
			<p>The Rocky Feature can be won during both main and free games.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Gamble</strong></p>
			<p>A win activates the <strong>Gamble</strong> button which, when clicked, starts the Gamble feature where you can bet the winnings from your last spin to try and increase them.</p>
			<p>Your current winnings are shown in the <strong>Bank</strong> field. You can choose to bet these winnings to double them by clicking <strong>Red</strong> or <strong>Black</strong>button. <strong>Double To</strong> shows the amount that will be placed in the <strong>Bank</strong>, if you win.</p>
			<p>If you do not want to bet, you can click <strong>Collect</strong> to add the winnings from the last spin to your balance and return to the main game. If you choose to bet, you have to guess whether the next card that is going to be revealed is red or black. If your guess is correct, you win. If your guess is wrong, you lose your bet and the Gamble feature ends.</p>
			<p>With every win, you can bet again until the winnings in the <strong>Bank</strong> are equal to or greater than the Gamble feature limit. The limit is shown on the <strong>Info</strong> page that describes the Gamble feature.</p>
			<p>Click <strong>Collect</strong> to add your winnings from the <strong>Bank</strong> to your balance and return to the main game.</p>
			<p><strong>Please note:</strong> The <strong>Gamble</strong> button is disabled during Free Games and while the <strong>Auto Start</strong> is active.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 95.02%.</p>
