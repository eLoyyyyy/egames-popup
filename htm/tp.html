			<p><strong>3-Reel 3-Row Multispin Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The object of Triple Profits is to obtain a winning symbol combination by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p>To play the game:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Choose the value of the coins you wish to wager each round, by clicking on the <strong>+</strong> and <strong>&ndash;</strong> buttons on the left of the screen.</li>
			<li>Click <strong>Bet One</strong> or <strong>Max Bet</strong> to select the number of coins you wish to wager. Each click on the <strong>Bet One</strong> button wagers one more coin. Pressing <strong>Max Bet</strong> increases your bet amount to the maximum amount possible &ndash; that is five coins &ndash; and spins the reels automatically. Remember that your total bet is three times the bet on one row. You can see your remaining credit, the bet amounts and win amount on the machine left of the reels.</li>
			<li>Click <strong>Spin</strong> (if you did not press <strong>Bet Max</strong>) to spin the reels.</li>
			<li>After the reels stop, select the reels you want to hold, by clicking on the <strong>Hold</strong> buttons beneath them or on the reels themselves. Click on <strong>Spin</strong> again to spin the reels you did not hold.</li>
			<li>If any of the rows show a winning combination after they stop, you win according to the winning table. Click the <strong>Paytable</strong>button to see the paytable, if you wish. Close the paytable by clicking the Paytable button again.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>About the winning tables:</strong></p>
			<p>The tables show a winning amount for every symbol combination that deserves a win. The payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet. If you have multiple wins on one line (a rare, but possible event), then only the biggest win is accounted for. If you have winning combinations on multiple lines, add them all up to get the winning amount.</p>
			<p>The gold bars with the word &ldquo;Wild&rdquo; written on it, is a wild symbol &ndash; meaning it stands for any other symbol, like a joker in card games.</p>
			<p><strong>Please note:</strong> There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much you're betting on a single payline. The total bet shows how much you're spending in this game round. The payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet, not by the total bet. If you get winning combinations on more than one payline, the winnings for each payline are added up.</p>
			<p><strong>Bonus Game:</strong></p>
			<p>Triple Profits contains a Bonus Game. To access the bonus game, you have to collect three stack of money symbols on one row. If you get three stacks on the first row and another three on the second, you get to play two bonus rounds, and the same goes for three. In the bonus game, choose two (if you did not play for max bet) or three (if you played for max bet) bags out of the 12. The bags contain a prize for you.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 98.72%.</p>
