			<p><strong>5-Reel 20-line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Plenty O'Fortune is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Line Bet</strong> to increase or decrease the amount.</li>
			<li>Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Lines</strong>. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the currently selected bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spins the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Mouse over the <strong>Auto Play</strong> button to display the list of options. Select the number of spins to be played automatically or choose &lsquo;Until Feature&rsquo; to spin until the Wishing Well Bonus, the End of the Rainbow Bonus or the Free Games Bonus round is triggered. Clicking on an option starts the Auto Play function. The <strong>Auto Play</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Play mode. The Auto Play mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when a Bonus round is triggered if you chose &lsquo;Until Feature&rsquo;, or when you click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Free Games Bonus</strong> screen explains how to play and win in the Free Games Bonus.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Wishing Well Bonus</strong> screen explains the symbol combinations necessary to enter the Bonus round and describes its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>End of the Rainbow Bonus</strong> screen describes the rules of the End of the Rainbow Bonus game.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Paylines</strong> screen illustrates all possible payline combinations.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels as illustrated in the <strong>Paylines</strong> screen of the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the left most reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Maximum Win Limit</strong></p>
			<p>The maximum win in the game has an upper limit. For more information, see the Terms and Conditions section.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol <img src="../img/gtspor_wild.jpg" alt="" /> can stand for any other symbol, except the 3 Bonus symbols (<img src="../img/gtspor_leprechaun.jpg" alt="" />, <img src="../img/gtspor_wishingwell.jpg" alt="" />, and <img src="../img/gtspor_potofgold.jpg" alt="" /> ), to make the best possible winning combination.</p>
			<p>There is also a separate payout for 2 or more Wild symbols on an active payline, as seen in the Paytable. This is paid out instead of the regular symbol win if the win amount from Wilds is larger than the win from the regular symbols (by Wild standing in).</p>
			<p><strong>Bonus Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>There are 3 Bonus symbols in the game: the Leprechaun <img src="../img/gtspor_leprechaun.jpg" alt="" />, the Wishing Well <img src="../img/gtspor_wishingwell.jpg" alt="" />, and the Pot Of Gold <img src="../img/gtspor_potofgold.jpg" alt="" />.</p>
			<p>The symbol of the <img src="../img/gtspor_leprechaun.jpg" alt="" /> appears only on reels 2, 3 and 4. If 3 or more <img src="../img/gtspor_leprechaun.jpg" alt="" /> appear anywhere on the reels simultaneously after a main game spin, the Free Games Bonus is triggered and you are awarded 12 Free Games. More information about the Free Games can be found <a href="../img/gtspor.html#free_games_section">here</a>.</p>
			<p>If 3 or more <img src="../img/gtspor_wishingwell.jpg" alt="" /> appear anywhere on the reels simultaneously after a main game spin, the Wishing Well Bonus is triggered. More information about the Wishing Well Bonus can be found <a href="../img/gtspor.html#wishingwell_bonus_section">here</a>.</p>
			<p>If 3 or more <img src="../img/gtspor_potofgold.jpg" alt="" /> appear anywhere on the reels simultaneously after a main game spin, the End of the Rainbow Bonus is triggered. More information about the End of the Rainbow Bonus can be found <a href="../img/gtspor.html#endofrainbow_bonus_section">here</a>.</p>
			<p><strong><a name="wishingwell_bonus_section"></a>Wishing Well Bonus</strong></p>
			<p>A title appears saying that the Wishing Well Bonus has been won. Immediately after that a leprechaun comes into sight and starts collecting coins that pour out from the Bonus symbols. Your total cash prize from the current Bonus round is being counted in a field on top of the reels.</p>
			<p>If 4 <img src="../img/gtspor_wishingwell.jpg" alt="" /> trigger the Wishing Well Bonus, your average prize will be twice as high.</p>
			<p>If 5 <img src="../img/gtspor_wishingwell.jpg" alt="" /> trigger the Wishing Well Bonus, your average prize will be 10 times as high.</p>

			<p>On the way to a mountain top where the big pot of gold awaits you, there is a winding path of little pots of gold. At every turn of the path you have to pick a pot by clicking on it. Each pot stands for either cash prize or Collect option. If you reach the final part of the path and win the last cash prize, you will automatically be awarded the big Bonus prize for successfully getting at the big pot of gold. If the Collect option occurs, however, you will still get a cash reward, but the Bonus round will end.</p>
			<p>If 4 <img src="../img/gtspor_potofgold.jpg" alt="" /> trigger the End of the Rainbow Bonus, your average prize will be twice as high.</p>
			<p>If 5 <img src="../img/gtspor_potofgold.jpg" alt="" /> trigger the End of the Rainbow Bonus, your average prize will be 10 times as high.</p>
			<p>The Wishing Well Bonus and the Free Games Bonus cannot be triggered during the End of the Rainbow Bonus.</p>
			<p>At the end of the Bonus game, a win screen displays your winnings. <strong>Game Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the main game that won the Bonus. <strong>Feature Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Bonus. <strong>Total Win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up). If no winnings were received during the spin that won the Bonus, then only the <strong>Total Win</strong> field will be shown.</p>
