			<p><strong>5-reel 25-line slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Wu Long is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking + and - below <strong>Line Bet</strong> to increase or decrease the amount.</li>
			<li>Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Lines</strong>. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the currently selected bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spin the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Mouse over the <strong>Auto Play</strong> button to display the list of options. Select the number of spins to be played automatically or choose <strong>Until Feature</strong> to spin until the Dragon's Free Games round is triggered. Clicking on an option starts the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. The <strong>Auto Play</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Play mode. The Auto Play mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the Dragon's Free Games round is triggered if you chose <strong>Until Feature</strong>, or when you click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Clicking the <strong>Turbo Mode</strong> button switches on or off the Turbo Mode thus turning on or off some of the win animations and sounds, and making the reels spin faster or slower.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In the case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Dragon's Free Games</strong> screen describes how the Free Games round is triggered and what its rules are.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Paylines</strong> screen illustrates all possible payline combinations and explains the payout rules in the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels. Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking + or - below <strong>Lines</strong>.</li>
			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round.Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the leftmost reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols <img src="../img/wlg_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> do not have to occur on any particular payline. If there are 3 or more Scatter symbols anywhere on the reels, the payout earned is multiplied by the total bet and added to line wins, if any.</p>
			<p>3 Scatter symbols appearing anywhere on the reels simultaneously during main game trigger the Dragon's Free Games with dynamic multiplier as explained <a href="../img/wlg.html#wlg_FG">here</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
			<ol>
			<li>During both main game and the Free Games round, <img src="../img/wlg_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> can stand for any other symbol to make the best possible winning combination. When a 5-of-a-kind winning combination of <img src="../img/wlg_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> has occurred along an active payline it will pay once as 5-of-a-kind Scatter and once as 5-of-a-kind <img src="../img/wlg_temple.jpg" alt="" /> as described in the <strong>Paytable</strong>.</li>
			<li>In 5-of-a-kind winning combinations where 4 or less <img src="../img/wlg_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> appear consecutively on a single line in the reel-spin results while substituting for a symbol, you will be paid once for 4-of-a-kind Scatter and once for the highest possible win combination per line according to the Paytable. For example, if the winning combination along an active payline is 4x <img src="../img/wlg_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> and 1x <img src="../img/wlg_drums.jpg" alt="" /> in this exact order you will be paid the combination of the highest payout according to the Paytable: either 5x <img src="../img/wlg_drums.jpg" alt="" />, or 4x <img src="../img/wlg_temple.jpg" alt="" /> (as a result of Scatter substituting) depending on which combination pays higher. In case the resulting payouts are equal, you will be randomly paid either of them. In addition, 4x <img src="../img/wlg_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> will pay as Scatter type pay.</li>
			</ol>
			<p><a name="wlg_FG"></a><strong>Dragon's Free Games</strong></p>
			<p>12 Free Games with initial multiplier of x1 are triggered by the appearance of 3 or more <img src="../img/wlg_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> during main game.</p>
			<p>To start the Free Games, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>.</p>
			<p>Whenever <img src="../img/wlg_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> appears anywhere on reels during the Free Games round it can either increase the multiplier or add Free Games to the existing ones, if any, as follows:</p>
			<table class="table">
			<tbody>
			<tr>
			<th><strong><span style="font-family: verdana;">Trigger</span></strong></th>
			<th><strong><span style="font-family: verdana;">Multiplier</span></strong></th>
			<th><strong><span style="font-family: verdana;">Free Games</span></strong></th></tr>
			<tr>
			<td>1x <img src="../img/wlg_scatter.jpg" alt="" /></td>
			<td>Multiplier increases from x1 to x2, or from x2 to x4, or from x4 to x6.</td>
			<td>-</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>2x <img src="../img/wlg_scatter.jpg" alt="" /></td>
			<td>Multiplier increases from x1 to x4, or from x2 or x4 to x 6.</td>
			<td>2 Free Games will be added to the remaining ones.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>3x <img src="../img/wlg_scatter.jpg" alt="" /></td>
			<td>Multiplier increases to x6 regardless of its current value.</td>
			<td>4 Free games will be added to the remaining ones.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>4x <img src="../img/wlg_scatter.jpg" alt="" /></td>
			<td>Multiplier increases to x6 regardless of its current value.</td>
			<td>8 Free games will be added to the remaining ones.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>5x <img src="../img/wlg_scatter.jpg" alt="" /></td>
			<td>Multiplier increases to x6 regardless of its current value.</td>
			<td>12 Free games will be added to the remaining ones.</td>
			</tr>
			</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>More Free Games can be won this way infinitely.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
			<ol>
			<li>Whenever you win a multiplier, it will apply to the Free Games reel-spin that has won the feature.</li>
			<li>If after a Free Games reel-spin no <img src="../img/wlg_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> appears, then the multiplier will go down 1 step. For example, if for the current spin your multiplier is x6 and no <img src="../img/wlg_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> has appeared on reels, a multiplier of x4 will apply to your next Free Games reel-spin results and so on until <img src="../img/wlg_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> appears on reels again.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same number of lines and bets per line as on the spin that won the Free Games round. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the spin that won the Free Games. <strong>Feature Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total Win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up). If there were no winnings in the main game reels that triggered the Free Games round, only <strong>Total Win</strong> will be shown.</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize. Free Games Win is added to the payline and Scatter wins.</p>
			<p>If the Free Games have been triggered during the Auto Play mode, the Free Games round begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. When all Free Games have been played and the player clicks <strong>Continue</strong> on the screen summarizing the Free Games win, the Auto Play mode resumes. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) depends on the number of lines played and ranges from 93.93% to 94.13%.</p>
