			<p><strong>5-Reel 25-line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Hot Gems is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking + and - below <strong>Line Bet</strong> to increase or decrease the amount.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X 25. This is due to the fact that the game is played using a fixed number of 25 active lines, no more, no less.</li>
			<li>Each spin can have multiple wins. After a spin win, the Collapsing Reels feature is triggered. All symbols that participated in winning combinations explode and the symbols on top of them fall down and take their empty places. New wins can be formed in this way repeatedly until no new wins are left in the new reel results.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the currently selected bet. During the reel spin the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking<strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Mouse over the <strong>Auto Play</strong> button to display the list of options. Select the number of spins to be played automatically or choose <strong>Until Feature</strong> to spin until the Free Games round is triggered. Clicking on an option starts the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. The Auto Play mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the Free Games round is triggered if you chose <strong>Until Feature</strong>, or when you click<strong>Stop</strong>. If the last Auto Play spin wins, the reels keep collapsing until new winning combinations are formed but further spins will not automatically begin.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings of the current screen and of previous winning screens of the same spin. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the accumulated win amount of that screen immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Collapsing Reels</strong> screen describes how this feature is triggered and how it works.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Free Games</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to trigger the Free Games feature and describes the Free Games feature rules.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Show Paylines</strong> on the <strong>Paytable</strong> page, opens a screen that illustrates all possible payline combinations. Clicking <strong>Hide Paylines</strong> closes this screen and returns to the <strong>Paytable</strong> page.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>All 25 lines are active during the game.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations of 3 or more Gold Digger <img src="../img/gts50_gd.jpg" alt="" /> symbols on an active payline can be achieved only by at least one Wild participating.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are added up.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations can only be on an active payline, must start from the leftmost reel and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Maximum Win Limit</strong></p>
			<p>The maximum win in the game has an upper limit. For more information, see the Terms and Conditions section.</p>
			<p><strong>Collapsing Reels</strong></p>
			<p>In Hot Gems, each spin can have multiple wins. If there is a win in the spin results, all symbols that participated in any winning combination explode, once all wins of that screen have been counted, and the symbols on top of them fall down and take their empty places. The reels keep collapsing this way as long as new winning combinations are formed. Winning <img src="../img/gts50_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> and <img src="../img/gts50_fg.jpg" alt="" /> symbols also explode.</p>
			<p>The Collapsing Reels feature is active during both main and Free Games.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol <img src="../img/gts50_wild.jpg" alt="" /> appears only on reels 2, 3 and 4. It can stand for any other symbol, except <img src="../img/gts50_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> and <img src="../img/gts50_fg.jpg" alt="" />, to make the best possible winning combination.</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols <img src="../img/gts50_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> do not have to occur on any particular payline. If there are two or more Scatter symbols in any position in the spin results, the payout earned is multiplied by the total bet and added to payline winnings.</p>
			<p><strong>Free Games Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Free Games symbols <img src="../img/gts50_fg.jpg" alt="" /> appear only on reels 1, 3 and 5 and only during the main game. When they appear anywhere on all 3 reels simultaneously, they trigger the Free Games feature.</p>
			<p><strong>Free Games</strong></p>
			<p>Free Games symbols in any position on reels 1, 3 and 5 simultaneously during the main game trigger 15 Free Games with Collapsing Reels Multiplier Feature. Free Games cannot be retriggered.</p>
			<p>Click <strong>Start Free Games</strong>. You will then be shown an animation that will reveal the number of Free Games you have won.</p>
			<p>Any spin during Free Games starts at multiplier X1. If there is a win, the multiplier goes up by +1 and any resulting winning combinations after the reels collapse are multiplied by this number. If there is a win in the new combination, the multiplier will go up +1, and so on. The maximum value the multiplier can reach is X5. New spins reset the multiplier to X1.</p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same number of lines and bets per line as on the spin that won the Free Games round. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the spin that won the Free Games. <strong>Feature Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total Win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up).</p>
			<p>If there were no winnings in the main game reels that triggered the Free Games round, only <strong>Total Win</strong> will be shown.</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p>Free Game wins are added to the payline and Scatter wins, if there are any.</p>
			<p>If the Free Games are triggered during the Auto Play mode, the feature begins after the player clicks on <strong>Start Free Games</strong> on the main game reels. When all Free Games have been played and the player clicks <strong>Continue</strong> on the screen summarizing the Free Games win, the Auto Play mode resumes automatically. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize. The <strong>Skip</strong> button can be used during Auto Play the same way as during regular game play.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 95.99%.</p>
