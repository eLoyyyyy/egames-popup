			<p><strong>5-Reel 40-line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Pink Panther is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>A wagering denomination (coin value) can be chosen by clicking the <strong>Click to Change</strong> denomination button in the lower left-hand corner of the screen.</li>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking <strong>Bet per Line</strong>. Each click adds a coin to the line bet. When the maximum amount is reached (10 coins of the selected wagering denomination), clicking the button again resets the line bet to one coin.</li>
			<li>Paylines are chosen by clicking <strong>Lines</strong>. Each click activates a payline. When all paylines are activated, clicking the button again resets it to one active payline. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the maximum bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spins the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Start</strong> function. Clicking + or &ndash; above <strong>Auto Start</strong> selects the successive number of spins to be enabled. Clicking <strong>Auto Start</strong> spins the reels. The <strong>Auto Start</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Start mode of reelspin. The Auto Start mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the player clicks <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>A win activates the <strong>Gamble</strong> button which, when clicked, starts the Gamble feature. More information about the Gamble feature can be found below.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Pink Pow</strong> screen describes how this feature is triggered and explains its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Crack The Pink Code Bonus</strong> screen describes how this bonus game is triggered and explains its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Color Pink Bonus</strong> screen describes how this bonus game is triggered and explains its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Wheel of Pink Bonus</strong> screen describes how this bonus game is triggered and explains its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Pink Trail Bonus</strong> screen describes how this bonus game is triggered and explains its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Jackpot Adventure</strong> screen describes how to win entry to the Progressive Jackpot game that wins one of two progressive jackpots or a fixed consolation prize, and explains the game rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Gamble</strong> screen describes how to try doubling winnings by gambling with them and describes the doubling-up rules.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Show Paylines</strong> on the <strong>Paytable</strong> page, opens a screen that illustrates all possible payline combinations. Clicking <strong>Hide Paylines</strong> closes this screen and returns to the <strong>Paytable</strong> page.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels. Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking <strong>Lines</strong>.</li>
			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>If a symbol has a winning combination on more than one reel, the winnings are added up.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the leftmost reel, and the symbols have to be on consecutive reels.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol in the game is the <img src="../img/pnp_wild.jpg" alt="" /> symbol. It can stand for any other symbol, except Scatter, to make the best possible winning combination. There is also a separate payout for two or more Wild symbols on an active payline, as seen in the Paytable. This is paid out instead of the regular symbol win if the win amount from Wilds is larger than the win from the regular symbols (by Wild standing in).</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbol in the game is the <img src="../img/pnp_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> symbol. The Scatter symbols do not have to occur on any particular payline. If there are three or more Scatters in the spin results, the payout earned is multiplied by the total bet and added to payline winnings.</p>
			<p>The four Bonus games, the Pink Pow feature and the Jackpot Adventure are all triggered randomly during the main game and cannot be triggered during Free Games. The Pink Pow feature, a bonus game, the Jackpot Adventure or any combination of them can be triggered simultaneously after a spin, including a spin with no game win.</p>
			<p><strong>Bonus games</strong></p>
			<p>When a bonus game is triggered, a long rope drops from above, near the animated Pink Panther, who is standing to the left of the reels. Once the win animations have played out, a message appears in front of the screen, saying that a Bonus game will begin. To enter the Bonus game, click on <strong>Start Bonus</strong>. The Pink Panther will then pull the rope and the screen will go dark, except for the Pink Panther&rsquo;s eyes. After a short pause, the Bonus game will begin.</p>
			<p><strong>Wheel of Pink Bonus</strong></p>
			<p>In this Bonus game, the Pink Panther spins two wheels. Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> starts the rotation. The external wheel may award a multiplier of x5, or x7, or x9 that will be applied to the player&rsquo;s total bet on the spin that triggered the feature. The inner wheel awards 2 options &ndash;<strong>Respin</strong> and <strong>Collect</strong>. <strong>Respin</strong> spins the wheels again, after clicking the <strong>Respin</strong> button. <strong>Collect</strong> gathers the prizes won and ends the Bonus game. <br />At the end of the Bonus game, click <strong>Continue</strong> to return to the main game.</p>
			<p><strong>The Color Pink Bonus</strong></p>
			<p>In the Color Pink Bonus game, the Pink Panther and the Little Man paint a wall of numbers in pink and blue, respectively. Each painted position in either color may reveal any of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Click on <strong>Paint</strong> to start painting. At the end of a painting round, the sum of the pink numbers is multiplied by the player&rsquo;s total bet on the spin that triggered the feature, to form the total Bonus win. <br />Choose either <strong>Repaint</strong> to try again or <strong>Collect</strong> to gather the prize and end the game. Up to 3 rounds can be played. At the end of the third round, the prize of that round is collected automatically. <br />At the end of the Bonus game, click <strong>Continue</strong> to return to the main game.</p>
			<p><strong>Pink Trail Bonus</strong></p>
			<p>A screen appears explaining the rules of the game. To start tracing, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>.<br />During this Bonus game, Inspector Clouseau is following footsteps for 4 rounds to find a stolen diamond. Each footstep wins a multiplier for the total bet of the spin, in which the Bonus was triggered, thus adding up to the total Bonus win. The number of footsteps in each round is random.<br />At the end of each round, choose either <strong>Continue</strong> or <strong>Collect</strong>. Choosing <strong>Collect</strong> gathers the prizes earned and ends the Bonus. Selecting <strong>Continue</strong> resumes the tracing of the footsteps but risks a trap that takes half of the prizes won and ends the game. Finishing all the four rounds successfully without falling into the trap, finds the diamond and multiplies the wins by 2. <br />At the end of the Bonus game, click <strong>Continue</strong> to return to the main game.</p>
			<p><strong>Crack the Pink Code Bonus and Free Games</strong></p>
			<p>During the Crack the Pink Code Bonus, you have to choose safes by clicking on them, one at a time. Each safe may stand for either 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 Free Games, or a Free Games win multiplier of x3 or x4, or an Expanding Wild, which, if awarded, will be available only on reel #3 during the Free Games round. A Free Game multiplier means that any win in the Free Games is multiplied by that number. Expanding Wild on reel #3 means that if a Wild symbol appears on reel #3 after a spin and it is possible to have a winning combination by having a Wild symbol anywhere on that reel, the Wild symbol will expand to cover the entire reel. All places on the reel will be temporarily considered as Wild. All winning combinations that result from this will be paid.<br />Click on a safe to reveal its contents. When the Pink Panther opens a safe with dynamite, one more prize is awarded and the Bonus game ends. <br />Click <strong>Continue</strong> to start the Free Games.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same number of lines and bets per line as on the spin that won the Free Games. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the spin that won the free games. <strong>Feature win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total win</strong> shows the aggregate winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up).</p>
			<p>The Bonus games, Pink Pow feature and the Progressive Jackpot Adventure cannot be triggered during Free Games. More Free Games cannot be retriggered.</p>
			<p><strong>The Pink Pow Feature</strong></p>
			<p>During the main game, after a spin, the Pink Panther randomly turns 2 to 6 symbols on the reels into Wilds. These Extra Wilds substitute for all symbols except Scatter. Scatter wins are paid before the Extra Wilds are distributed.</p>
			<p><strong>The Jackpot Adventure</strong></p>
			<p>During the Jackpot Adventure feature you are guaranteed to win either the Major Pink Jackpot, or the Minor Pink Jackpot, or, in case none has been awarded, the consolation prize. The two different jackpots and the consolation prize award different cash amounts as explained below.<br />The jackpot gamescreen shows 12 doors and you choose which ones to open. Behind each door one of the following three characters may appear: the Pink Panther, Inspector Clouseau or the Little Man. Opening 5 Pink Panther doors wins the Major Pink jackpot. Opening 4 Inspector Clouseau doors wins the Minor Pink jackpot. Opening 3 Little Man doors wins the fixed consolation prize. It is also possible that there is one empty door with no character behind it at all. <br />The Jackpot Adventure game has a reaction timer. This means that if you do not pick doors in a set amount of time, the doors will open automatically and you will win your prize.</p>
			<p>The Jackpot for this game works like this:</p>
			<table class="table">
			<tbody>
			<tr>
			<td><strong>Seed</strong> (how much money the Jackpot starts out with):</td>
			<td>Major Pink: 1000$<br />Minor Pink: 100$<br />Consolation Prize: 80$</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td><strong>Contribution rate</strong> (what percentage of each bet goes into the Jackpot):</td>
			<td>1.40%</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td><strong>Win condition</strong> (the result you have to get to win the Jackpot):</td>
			<td>Open:<br />5 Pink Panther doors to win the Major Pink;<br />4 Inspector Clouseau doors to win the Minor Pink;<br />3 Little Man doors to win the Consolation Prize.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td><strong>Win requirements </strong>(what you need to do to be eligible for the Jackpot):</td>
			<td>Play a Jackpot Adventure slot game.</td>
			</tr>
			</tbody>
			</table>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> In case a player wins the Jackpot Adventure feature while it is being played by another player, the round that has already begun should be finished so that the 2<sup>nd</sup> player can enter the feature. In case both players win the Major Pink Jackpot, one after the other, the 1<sup>st</sup> player will be awarded the progressive part, while the 2<sup>nd</sup> one will win its corresponding seed and the progressive part that has been accumulated for the time between the winning of the Major Pink Jackpot by the 1<sup>st</sup> player and by the 2nd one.</p>
			<p>If a Jackpot is being discontinued (a game is closed and removed from the casino client), you will be notified of it by the casino.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Gamble</strong></p>

You can choose to bet these winnings (<strong>Double</strong> button) to double them. <strong>Double To</strong>shows the amount that will be placed in the <strong>Bank</strong>, if you win. <br />You can also choose to bet only half your current winnings (<strong>Double Half</strong> button) and keep the other half in the <strong>Bank</strong>. <strong>Double Half To</strong>shows the amount that will be placed in the <strong>Bank</strong> (includes the amount that remained in the <strong>Bank</strong>), if you win.<br /><strong>Bet</strong> will show your bet in the Gamble round.</p>
			<p>If you do not want to bet, you can click <strong>Collect</strong> to add the winnings from the last spin to your balance and return to the main game. If you choose to bet, the dealer&rsquo;s card is revealed on the left-hand side of the screen and you have to pick a card from the remaining face-down cards. If you pick a card with a higher ranking than the dealer&rsquo;s card, you win. If your card is equal in ranking, the bet is returned. If your card is lower in ranking than the dealer&rsquo;s card, you lose your bet and the Gamble feature ends.</p>
