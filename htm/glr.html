			<p><strong>5-Reel 25-line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The object of Gladiator is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>A wagering denomination (coin value) can be chosen by clicking the <strong>Click to Change</strong> denomination button in the lower left-hand corner of the screen.</li>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking <strong>Bet per Line</strong>. Each click adds a coin to the line bet. When the maximum amount is reached (10 coins of the selected wagering denomination), clicking the button again resets the line bet to one coin.</li>
			<li>Paylines are chosen by clicking <strong>Lines</strong>. Each click activates a payline. When all paylines are activated, clicking the button again resets it to one active payline. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spins the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Start</strong> function. Clicking + or &ndash; above <strong>Auto Start</strong> selects the successive number of spins to be enabled. Clicking <strong>Auto Start</strong> spins the reels. The <strong>Auto Start</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Start mode of reelspin. The Auto Start mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the player clicks <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			</li>
			<li>A win activates the Gamble button which, when clicked, starts the Gamble feature. More information about the Gamble feature can be found below.</li>
			<li>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Coliseum Bonus</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to enter the Coliseum Bonus round and describes the Coliseum Bonus round rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Gladiator Bonus</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to trigger the Gladiator Bonus round and describes the Gladiator Bonus round.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Gamble</strong> screen describes how to try doubling winnings by gambling with them and describes the doubling-up rules.</li>
			</ul>
			<li><strong>Show Paylines</strong> can be clicked from the Paytable page to open a screen which illustrates all possible payline combinations. Clicking <strong>Hide Paylines</strong> closes this screen and returns to the <strong>Paytable</strong> page.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels. Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking <strong>Lines</strong>.</li>
			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>If a symbol has a winning combination on more than one reel, the winnings are added up.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are added up.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the left most reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild symbol</strong><br />The Wild symbol in the games is the <img src="../img/gladiator_sym13.jpg" alt="" /> symbol. Wild symbols can appear only on reels 2, 3 and 4 and stand for any other symbol, except Scatter, to make the best possible winning combination. Wild symbols do not have a regular win, they only win when substituting.<br />If three Wild symbols appear simultaneously in any position on the reels 2, 3 and 4, the <strong>Gladiator Bonus</strong> round is initiated.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Scatter symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbol in the game is the  <img src="../img/gladiator_sym12.jpg" alt="" /> symbol. Scatter symbols do not have to occur on a particular payline &ndash; if there are two or more Scatter symbols in the spin results, an additional win is earned and added to payline winnings. The payout for the Scatter symbols is multiplied by the total bet. If three or more Scatter symbols appear simultaneously on the reels, the <strong>Coliseum Bonus</strong> round is initiated.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>The Gladiator Bonus round</strong></p>
			<p>The Gladiator Bonus round is triggered when three Wild symbols appear simultaneously in any position on the reels 2, 3 and 4.<br />In the Gladiator Bonus round, a centered window reveals 9 helmets in either gold, silver or bronze, with prize values equal to 5, 3 or 1 times the total bet respectively. The Gladiator Bonus round prize equals the total value of those 9 helmets.</p>
			<p><strong>The Coliseum Bonus round</strong></p>
			<p>The Coliseum Bonus round is triggered when three or more Scatter symbols appear in any position on the reels. To start the bonus round, click <strong>Start</strong>.</p>
			<p>The Coliseum Bonus round includes a grid of four rows and five columns. Starting from the bottom row, the player picks one stone at a time from the rows to win a prize.<br />Stones picked from the first row determine the number of free games. Each pick may award 4, 5, 7, 10, or 12 Free Games.<br />Stones picked from the second row reveal the win multiplier to be used during the free games. Each pick may award a multiplier of x1, x2, or x3.<br />Stones picked from the third row reveal an Extra Scatter symbol to be used during the free games. <br />Stones picked from the fourth row reveal an Extra Wild symbol to be used during the free games.</p>
			<p>Extra Wild can be one of the five theme symbols (characters from the movie Gladiator) only. <br />Extra Scatter can be one of the theme symbols except <img src="../img/gladiator_sym11.jpg" alt="" /> and <img src="../img/gladiator_sym10.jpg" alt="" /> or one of the royals symbols (A, K, Q, J, 10, 9).</p>
			<p>Extra Wild and Extra Scatter appear just as the original symbol but act as Wild or Scatter symbol respectively.</p>
			<p>When a stone is picked, one of the following occurs:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>The next pick is made from the row above.</li>
			<li>An extra pick is given in the currently active row (applies only for the first and second row).</li>
			<li>The whole column is automatically opened.</li>
			<li>The selected stone reveals a Collect item &ndash; the bonus round ends and the Free Games start.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The win multiplier applies to all line wins and Scatter and Extra Scatter wins during the Free Games.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same number of lines and bets per line as on the spin that won the Coliseum Bonus. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the spin that won the free games. <strong>Feature win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total win</strong> shows the aggregate winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up).</p>
			<p><br />During the Free Games, the Coliseum Bonus round can not be retriggered. However, if <img src="../img/gladiator_sym11.jpg" alt="" /> appears on reel 3 during the Free Games, 3 extra Free Games are added to the remaining ones. The win multiplier, Extra Wild and Extra Scatter symbols do not change.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the Gladiator Bonus round can occur. Note that Extra Wild does not substitute the Wild symbol towards the Gladiator Bonus round. In addition, the Free Games win multiplier does not apply on the Gladiator Bonus round prizes.</p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the Wild and Extra Wild substitute for all symbols, except Scatter and Extra Scatter. Wild also substitutes for the Extra Wild theme symbol. Note that Extra Wild can still win according to the payout of the original symbol when the symbols appear on an active payline. This is paid out if the win amount from the Extra Wild is larger than the win from the regular symbol (by Extra Wild standing in).</p>
			<p>The Extra Scatter symbols do not have to occur on a particular payline &ndash; if there are three or more Extra Scatter symbols in the Free Game results, an additional win is earned and added to payline winnings. The Extra Scatter wins according to the payout of the original symbol, but the payout is multiplied by the total bet.</p>
			<p><strong>Gamble</strong></p>
			<p>A win activates the <strong>Gamble</strong> button which, when clicked, starts the Gamble feature where you can bet the winnings from your last spin to try and increase them.</p>
			<p>Your current winnings are shown in the <strong>Bank</strong> field. You can choose to bet these winnings to double them by clicking <strong>Red</strong> or <strong>Black</strong>button. <strong>Double To</strong> shows the amount that will be placed in the <strong>Bank</strong>, if you win.</p>
			<p>If you do not want to bet, you can click <strong>Collect</strong> to add the winnings from the last spin to your balance and return to the main game. If you choose to bet, you have to guess whether the next card that is going to be revealed is red or black. If your guess is correct, you win. If your guess is wrong, you lose your bet and the Gamble feature ends.</p>
			<p>With every win, you can bet again until the winnings in the <strong>Bank</strong> are equal to or greater than the Gamble feature limit. The limit is shown on the <strong>Info</strong> page that describes the Gamble feature.</p>
			<p>Click <strong>Collect</strong> to add your winnings to your balance and return to the main game.</p>
			<p><strong>Please note</strong> The <strong>Gamble</strong> button is disabled during free spins and while the <strong>Auto Start</strong> is active.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 94.09%.</p>
