			<p><strong>3-Reel 3-Line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The object of Fountain of Youth is to obtain a winning symbol combination by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p><strong>Please note:</strong> There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much you're betting on a single payline. The total bet shows how much you're spending in this game round.&nbsp;The payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the coin size, not the line bet. If you get winning combinations on more than one payline, the winnings for each payline are added up.</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Choose the value of the coins you wish to wager each round, by clicking on the <strong>+</strong> and <strong>&ndash;</strong> buttons on the left of the screen.</li>
			<li>Click <strong>Bet One</strong> or <strong>Bet Max</strong> to select the number of coins you wish to wager. Each click on the <strong>Bet One</strong> button adds another coin to the bet. One payline is activated for every coin you bet. You will only win if a combination occurs on an activated payline. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> increases the number of paylines to the maximum &ndash; that is, three lines &ndash; and spins the reels automatically.</li>
			<li>Click <strong>Spin</strong> (if you did not press <strong>Bet Max</strong>), or click on the arm, to spin the reels.</li>
			<li>If the reels show a winning combination after they stop (along an activated payline), you win according to the winning table (see the top panel of the machine). To find the winning amount, multiply your coin value with the number in the winnings table (on the appropriate row). If you win on multiple lines simultaneously, your winnings are added up.&nbsp;</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 96.81%.</p>
