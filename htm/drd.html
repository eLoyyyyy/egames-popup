			<p><strong>5-reel 20-line slots</strong></p>

			<p>The object of Daredevil is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>

			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>A wagering denomination (coin value) can be chosen by clicking the <strong>Click to Change</strong> denomination button in the lower left-hand corner of the screen.</li>
				<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking <strong>Bet per Line</strong>. Each click adds a coin to the line bet. When the maximum amount is reached, clicking the button again resets the line bet to one coin.</li>
				<li>Paylines are chosen by clicking <strong>Lines</strong>. Each click activates a payline. When all paylines are activated, clicking the button again resets it to one active payline. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the currently selected bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
				<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
				<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spins the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
				<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Start</strong> function. Clicking + or &ndash; above <strong>Auto Start</strong> selects the successive number of spins to be enabled. Clicking <strong>Auto Start</strong> spins the reels. The <strong>Auto Start</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Start mode of reelspin. The Auto Start mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the player clicks <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
				<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
				<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
				<li>In case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
				<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			</ul>
			<strong>Info page:</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables you to navigate between the different info screens.
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all the winning combinations.</li>
				<li><strong>Free Games with Random Wilds</strong> screen describes the Free Games rules.</li>
				<li><strong>Bullseye Feature</strong> screen explains the behavior of the Bullseye Feature.</li>
				<li><strong>Marvel Multi-Level Mystery Progressive Jackpot</strong> screen describes how to win entry to the Marvel Multi-Level Mystery Progressive Jackpot game that wins one of four jackpots, and explains the game’s rules.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
				<li>Clicking <strong>Show Paylines</strong> on the <strong>Paytable</strong> page, opens a screen that illustrates all possible payline combinations. Clicking Hide Paylines closes this screen and returns to the <strong>Paytable</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> closes the Info screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<strong>Paylines:</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels. Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking <strong>Lines</strong>.</li>
				<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
				<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>

			<strong>About payouts:</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
				<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
				<li>Winning combinations must start from the left most reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>

			<p><strong>Wild symbol</strong></p>

			<p>The Wild symbol in the game is the <img src="http://cache.download.banner.longsnake88.com/flash/42/[en]/help/daredevil_sym0.jpg" /> symbol. It can stand for any other symbol, except Scatter, to make the best possible winning combination. In addition, two or more Wild symbols on an active payline pay as per the rules of the Paytable.</p>

			<strong>Scatter symbol</strong>

			<p>The Scatter symbol in the game is the <img src="../img/daredevil_sym12.jpg" /> symbol. The Scatter symbols do not have to occur on any particular payline. If there are two or more Scatter symbols in the spin results, an additional win is earned. The payout for the Scatter symbols is multiplied by the total bet.</p>

			<p>If 3 or more Scatter symbols appear on the reels simultaneously, regardless of position, 10 Free Games with Random Wilds are awarded (see below).</p>

			<strong>Bullseye feature</strong>

			<p>Before a spin, the player has to place the <img src="../img/daredevil_target.jpg" /> on one of the 15 reel positions on the reels by clicking on the selected place. If, after a spin, the Bullseye symbol <img src="../img/daredevil_sym3.jpg" /> ends up under the target, a win is awarded, paying 3 times the total bet. The target remains in its last position for any following spins unless the player relocates it. When the game begins, the target’s default location is the center of the reels.</p>

			<p>The Bullseye feature is not available during Free Games.</p>

			<p>When entering the game, a pop-up message appears on the reels, explaining that there is a new Bullseye feature. Pressing on 'X' causes the message to disappear. Pressing on the message brings the player to the info page explaining the Bullseye feature rules. Clicking on 'Don't display this message again' causes the message to not appear again.</p>

			<p><strong>Free Games</strong></p>

			<p>3 or more Scatter symbols trigger the Free Games. To begin, the player must click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>.A win message appears on the screen. The message changes automatically to the Free Game reels, which then spin automatically.</p>

			<p>After every spin in Free Games, the reels are scanned and 0, 1, 2 or 3 randomly chosen symbols on the reels are turned into Wilds. A Random Wild means that the symbol substitutes for all symbols, except Scatter. Any symbol can be turned into a Random Wild, including Scatter symbols. Scatter wins will nonetheless be paid, even if the Scatter was turned into a Random Wild.</p>

			<p>If 3 or more Scatter symbols appear anywhere on the reels during Free Games, the player is awarded 10 more Free Games.</p>

			<p>During the free spins, the reels are spun automatically using the same number of lines and bets per line as on the spin that won the free spins. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Spin Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current free spins.</p>

			<p>After all free spins have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the spin that won the free spins. <strong>Feature win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the free spins. <strong>Total win</strong> shows the aggregate winnings (Game Win and Bonus Win added up).</p>

			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game.</p>

			<p>At the end of the Free Games, a special screen detailing the feature wins appears. To return to the main game, click <strong>Continue</strong>.</p>

			<p><strong>Marvel Mystery Jackpot</strong></p>

			<p>Marvel Mystery Jackpot is a multi-level progressive jackpot game that is available in all Marvel games and is linked to all Marvel games. A small percentage of each bet in the Marvel games, by every person playing this game in each of many online casinos, is added to the progressive jackpot.</p>

			<p>The trigger that starts the Jackpot game is random and can occur after any spin in any of the linked games. It is not caused by any symbol combination in the linked games and even a spin that does not win anything in the main game can trigger the Jackpot game. Likewise, any bet with any size in the linked games can trigger the Jackpot game. Nonetheless, the chances of triggering the Jackpot game increase or decrease proportionally to the bet size. Entering the Jackpot game guarantees a win of one of the four jackpots. Playing the Jackpot game reveals the jackpot that has been awarded to you, but does not determine it.</p>

			<p>There are four different levels of jackpots that you can win: Power Jackpot, Extra Power Jackpot, Super Power Jackpot and Ultimate Power Jackpot. Different types of jackpots hold different prize amounts. The jackpot gamescreen contains 20 squares which in the beginning of the gameplay are turned upside down. Clicking on a square will turn it around and reveal one of four jackpot symbols on the other side. Once you have found three matching symbols, you win the jackpot that corresponds to these symbols. Jackpot winnings are added to the main game winnings (if any) and are displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field together with any other winnings.</p>

			<p>The Marvel Mystery Jackpot game has a timeout timer. This means that if you do not pick a square in a set amount of time, you will automatically receive your prize.</p>

			The Jackpot for this game works like this:
			<table class="table">
			<tbody>
			<tr>
			<td><strong>Seed</strong> (how much money the Jackpots start out with):</td>
			<td>
				<ul class="list-unstyled">
					<li>Power: &euro;50</li>
					<li>Extra Power: &euro;500</li>
					<li>Super Power: &euro;5,000</li>
					<li>Ultimate Power: &euro;100,000</li>
				</ul>
			</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td><strong>Contribution rate</strong> (what percentage of each bet goes into Jackpot):</td>
			<td>0.99%</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td><strong>Win condition</strong> (the result you have to get to win the Jackpot):</td>
			<td>Entering the jackpot game guarantees a win. Match 3 jackpot symbols of the corresponding Jackpot or wait for the timer to run out.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td><strong>Win requirements</strong> (what you need to do to be eligible for the Jackpot):</td>
			<td>Play a Marvel game.</td>
			</tr>
			</tbody>
			</table>
			<strong>Please note:</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>The seed and Jackpot values are in Euros in the progressive network and their value in your local currency is dependent on the currency exchange rate.</li>
				<li>The mechanics of Marvel Mystery Jackpot prohibit simultaneous jackpot winnings.</li>
				<li>Imperfections in the Internet connectivity may cause you to experience delays in Jackpot messages or updates, but they do not affect actual Jackpot wins.</li>
			</ul>
			<strong>Return to Player</strong>

			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 94.94%.</p>
