			<p><strong>5-Reel 25-line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of The Mummy is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking + and - below <strong>Line Bet</strong> to increase or decrease the amount.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X 25. This is due to the fact that the game is played using a fixed number of 25 active lines, no more, no less.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the currently selected bet. During the reel spin the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking<strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Mouse over the <strong>Auto Play</strong> button to display the list of options. Select the number of spins to be played automatically or choose <strong>Until Feature</strong> to spin until any special feature is triggered. Clicking on an option starts the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. The Auto Play mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when a special feature is triggered if you chose <strong>Until Feature</strong>, or when you click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In the case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Lost City Adventure Bonus</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to enter the Lost City Adventure Bonus and describes its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Choose Your Feature</strong> screen on Info page 3 explains how the 8 special features are activated.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Choose Your Feature</strong> screen on Info page 4 describes the Scorpion Scatter Feature, Expanding Mummy and Scarab Attack special features.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Choose Your Feature</strong> screen on Info page 5 describes the Collapsing Reels, Mummy Power and Mummy Respin special features.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Free Games With Super Spin Feature</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to enter the Free Games feature and describes the Free Games feature rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Mummy Hunt Bonus</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to enter the Mummy Hunt Bonus and describes its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Paylines</strong> screen illustrates all possible payline combinations and explains the payout rules in the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>All 25 lines are active during the game.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol and the Scorpion Scatter symbol during the Scorpion Scatter Feature are exceptions to these rules. More information about these symbols can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are added up.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations can only be on an active payline, must start from the leftmost reel and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol and the Scorpion Scatter symbol during the Scorpion Scatter Feature are exceptions to these rules. More information about these symbols can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol <img src="../img/mmy_wild.jpg" alt="" /> appears only on reels 2, 3 and 4. It can stand for any other symbol, except Scatter <img src="../img/mmy_scatter.jpg" alt="" />, Scorpion Scatter <img src="../img/mmy_scorpion_scatter.jpg" alt="" />, Bonus <img src="../img/mmy_hunt.jpg" alt="" /> and Free Games <img src="../img/mmy_fg.jpg" alt="" /> to make the best possible winning combination.</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols <img src="../img/mmy_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> do not have to occur on any particular payline. If there are three or more Scatter symbols in any position in the spin results, the payout earned is multiplied by the total bet and added to payline winnings.</p>
			<p><strong>Bonus Features</strong></p>
			<p>When you enter the game for the first time, you can play only the Lost City Adventure Bonus. No other special features are available in the game. As you play the game, more features will be unlocked.</p>
			<p><strong>Lost City Adventure Bonus</strong></p>
			<p>The Lost City Adventure Bonus is triggered randomly during main game.</p>
			<p>To start it, click on <strong>Click to Start.</strong></p>
			<p>First you will be shown a clip from The Mummy movie sequel, then you will be taken to a chamber in the Lost City. Pick ancient crates for cash until Collect is chosen, which ends the Bonus and activates one of the special features in the following order: Scorpion Scatter Feature, Expanding Mummy, Scarab Attack, Free Games, Collapsing Reels, Mummy Power, Mummy Hunt Bonus and Mummy Respin. If all these features have been unlocked, Collect will simply end the Bonus.</p>
			<p>Click on an ancient crate to make a selection. Not more than 6 ancient crates can be selected. Every selection either wins a cash prize, which is a multiple (from x1 to x4) of the total bet on the spin that triggered the Bonus, or is Collect. All cash prizes are added up.</p>
			<p>At the end of the Bonus game, if you won a feature, you will be shown a special book that gives a short description of the feature won. After a short pause, a win screen displays your winnings. <strong>Game Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the main game spin that won the Bonus. <strong>Feature Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Bonus. <strong>Total Win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up). In addition, if you won a feature, it will also appear in the win results. If no winnings were received during the spin that won the Bonus, then only the <strong>Total Win</strong> field will be shown. On this screen you can also see which special feature is unlocked by this Bonus game, unless all of them have been already activated.</p>
			<p>Click <strong>Continue</strong> to return to the slot reels.</p>
			<p>Winning a feature automatically activates it when returning to the main game. You can activate another feature at any time during the main game, if you have unlocked it.</p>
			<p>If the Bonus is triggered during the Auto Play mode, the feature begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. The player has to make selections until Collect is chosen, which ends the Bonus. When the Bonus is over and the player clicks <strong>Continue</strong> on the screen summarizing the Bonus win, the Auto Play mode resumes. When returning to the reels, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p>Every time you play the Lost City Adventure Bonus, you activate one of the eight special features to be used in the main game, in the following order: Scorpion Scatter Feature, Expanding Mummy, Scarab Attack, Free Games, Collapsing Reels, Mummy Power, Mummy Hunt Bonus and Mummy Respin.</p>
			<p>Six of them occupy each of the six empty places to the left of the reels and can be activated at anytime by clicking on the respective feature logo. The activated feature remains active until another special feature is activated.</p>
			<p>The other two of the special features add special symbols to the reels: Free Games Symbols <img src="../img/mmy_fg.jpg" alt="" /> that can trigger the Free Games feature and Mummy Hunt Bonus Symbols <img src="../img/mmy_hunt.jpg" alt="" />, which can trigger the Mummy Hunt Bonus. Winning each of these features adds the special symbols to the reels permanently.</p>
			<p>The state of the features won as well as the special symbols added to the reels is saved when exiting and restored when re-entering the game.</p>
			<p>The special features are the following:</p>
			<p><strong>Scorpion Scatter Feature</strong></p>
			<p>Once this feature is activated, the <img src="../img/mmy_scorpion_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> symbol becomes Extra Scatter and pays with a special paytable. The Scorpion Extra Scatter symbol doesn&rsquo;t have to appear on any particular payline in order to win. If there are two or more of these symbols in any position in the spin results, the payout earned is multiplied by the total bet and added to payline winnings.</p>
			<p><strong>Expanding Mummy</strong></p>
			<p>Enabling this feature converts the Wild symbol into Expanding Wild. Every time the Wild symbol appears anywhere on a reel and it is possible to have a winning combination by having it substitute for any other symbol on that reel, it expands to cover the entire reel. All positions on that reel are considered as Wild symbols. All resulting winning combinations are paid.</p>
			<p><strong>Scarab Attack</strong></p>
			<p>If this feature is enabled and a Wild symbol appears anywhere on reel 3, two more Wild symbols are distributed: one randomly on reel 2 and the other randomly on reel 4. Scatter wins are paid before Random Wild symbols are distributed.</p>
			<p><strong>Free Games</strong></p>
			<p>Once the player wins the Free Games special symbols, they are permanently added to the reels, making it possible to trigger the 5 Free Games and 1 Super Spin feature.</p>
			<p>Free Games symbols appear only on reels 1, 3 and 5. When they appear on all 3 reels simultaneously, in any position, during the main game, they trigger the 5 Free Games and 1 Super Spin feature.</p>
			<p>To start the 5 Free Games and 1 Super Spin feature, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. A message appears saying that 5 Free Games and 1 Super Spin feature follows. After a while the feature begins automatically.</p>
			<p>During the first 5 Free Games, the number of Wild symbols that appear anywhere on the reels is counted and stored at the left side of the reels, under &lsquo;Collected Wilds&rsquo;. After five free spins, the Super Spin begins: the collected number of Wild symbols is distributed randomly on reels 2, 3 and 4 and freeze there for the duration of one additional spin. Not more than 9 Wild symbols can be distributed in this way. Scatter wins are paid before the Wild symbols are distributed.</p>
			<p>More Free Games cannot be retriggered. The Lost City Adventure Bonus and Mummy Hunt Bonus cannot be triggered during the Free Games.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>During the feature, the reels are spun automatically using the same bet per line as on the spin that won the feature. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the main game spin that won the Free Games. <strong>Feature Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total Win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up).</p>
			<p>If no winnings were received during the spin that won the Bonus, then only the <strong>Total Win</strong> field will be shown. On this screen you can also see which special feature is unlocked by this Bonus game, unless all of them have been already activated.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p>Free Game wins are added to the payline and Scatter wins.</p>
			<p>If the Free Games are triggered during the Auto Play mode, the feature begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. When all Free Games have been played and the player clicks <strong>Continue</strong> on the screen summarizing the Free Games win, the Auto Play mode resumes. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p><strong>Collapsing Reels</strong></p>
			<p>If there is a win in the spin results, all symbols that participated in any winning combination explode, once all wins of that screen have been counted, and the symbols on top of them fall down and take their empty places. The reels keep collapsing this way as long as new winning combinations are formed.</p>
			<p>Winning <img src="../img/mmy_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> symbols also &lsquo;explode&rsquo;.</p>
			<p><img src="../img/mmy_fg.jpg" alt="" /> symbols and <img src="../img/mmy_hunt.jpg" alt="" /> symbols do not &lsquo;explode&rsquo;.</p>
			<p><strong>Mummy Power</strong></p>
			<p>While the Mummy Power feature is active, every Wild that substitutes in a winning combination on an active payline, multiplies the line bet by x3. If there are more than one Wild symbols substituting on a payline, the win from that payline is equal to three times their number multiplied by the line bet. The accumulated wins from all active paylines form the total spin win.</p>
			<p><strong>Mummy Hunt Bonus</strong></p>
			<p>Mummy Hunt Bonus symbols anywhere on reels 1 and 5 simultaneously, in any position, during the main game trigger the Mummy Hunt Bonus.</p>
			<p>To start it, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. An animation will lead you to the depths of the pyramid. Click on Continue and the Bonus begins.</p>
			<p>In the Mummy Hunt Bonus, the player hunts mummies for cash. In each Bonus round, the player kills at least 2 and not more than 10 mummies. All cash prizes are a multiple (X1, X2 or X3) of the total bet on the spin that triggered the feature and are added up. The player is repeatedly faced with crossroads, where left or right turn must be chosen. A crossroad can lead to a dead end where mummies ambush you and end the Bonus, or to a mummy that you kill, win a cash prize for, and continue to the next crossroad. The Bonus ends when a dead end is reached or 10 mummies are captured successfully. As you kill mummies, you will be able to see your progress in the pyramid as well as the number of mummies you have hunted down in a special map at the top right of the screen.</p>
			<p>If you hunted down all 10 mummies, you will see a video clip from The Mummy movie, before taken to the win screen.</p>
			<p>At the end of the Bonus game, a win screen displays your winnings. <strong>Game Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the main game that won the Bonus. <strong>Feature Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Bonus. <strong>Total Win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up). If no winnings were received during the spin that won the Bonus, then only the <strong>Total Win</strong> field will be shown.<br />Click <strong>Continue</strong> to return to the slot reels.</p>
			<p>If the Bonus is triggered during the Auto Play mode, the feature begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. The player makes selections until reaching a dead end or hunting 10 mummies. When the Bonus is over and the player clicks <strong>Continue</strong> on the screen summarizing the Bonus win, the Auto Play mode resumes. When returning to the reels, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p><strong>Mummy Respin</strong></p>
			<p>Every time a Wild symbol appears anywhere on the reels while this feature is active, the reel that has a Wild symbol on it freezes in place, while the rest of the reels spin. These spins continue until some kind of win is formed. All these extra respins are free. If other Wild symbols appear on the reels while spinning, they do not freeze. You have to click on <strong>Click to Start</strong> to trigger the special respins.</p>
			<p>The Lost City Adventure Bonus can be triggered during the first spin that triggers the feature but not during any of the respins.</p>
			<p>If the Mummy Hunt Bonus or the Free Games Feature is activated simultaneously with the Mummy Respin feature, the game will first play the Bonus or the Free Games Feature, then return to the main game to play out the rest of the respins.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 92.02%.</p>
