			<p>You can place various bets on where the three dart throws will hit. Click the bet menu in the upper right corner of the screen to open and close sections containing the bet options. The payout multiplier is shown next to each bet. Select a bet option, use the + and - buttons to increase and decrease your bet amount, then click on Confirm to place the bet. You can place up to five bets per game round.</p>

			<p>The Dartboard:</p>

			<p>The dartboard consists of the single ring, the double ring, the treble ring, the outer bull and the bullseye. The single ring is the largest part on the dartboard. It consists of two areas - one between the double ring and the treble ring, the other between the treble ring and the outer bull. It is divided into sectors which are colored yellow and black. Each sector has a certain number, written on the outer edge of the dartboard. A dart that hits the single ring scores as many points as the number written on the corresponding sector.</p>

			<p>There are two narrow circles on the dartboard. The outer narrow circle is the double ring, the inner narrow circle is the treble ring. A dart that hits the double ring scores double the amount of points of the corresponding sector. A dart that hits the treble ring scores triple the amount of points of the corresponding sector.</p>

			<p>The outer bull is the small circle surrounding the bullseye. It is worth 25 points. The bullseye is the center of the dartboard, it is worth 50 points.</p>

			<p>Bets:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><p>Singles - bet on how many darts hit the single ring.</p></li>

				<li><p>Doubles - bet on how many darts hit the double ring.</p></li>

				<li><p>Trebles - bet on how many darts hit the treble ring.</p></li>

				<li><p>Outer Bull - bet that at least one dart hits the outer bull.</p></li>

				<li><p>Inner Bull - bet that at least one dart hits the bullseye.</p></li>

				<li><p>Lo/Mid/Hi - bet that the total score of all three darts will be in a certain range.</p></li>

				<li><p>1-20 Singles - bet that at least one dart hits the single ring of a certain sector. Click on the dartboard to select sectors. You can bet on up to five sectors in one 1-20 Singles bet. Regardless of the amount of sectors included in this type of bet, it still only counts as one bet in regard to the maximum number of bets allowed per game.</p></li>
			</ul>

			<p>Please note that you cannot have more than four different bets.</p>

			<p>When finished placing bets, click Throw to throw the darts. If any of your bets win, you will get the appropriate payout. To place the same bets again, click Rebet.</p>

			<h4>Jackpot</h4>

			<p>One of the possible wins in this game is the progressive Jackpot, built up by all the casinos that offer the game. A small percentage of each bet, by every person playing this game in each of many online casinos, is added to a common pot. When a player gets the right result, that player wins the entire Jackpot (in some games you can also win part of it).</p>

			<p>After a Jackpot has been won, a new pot is started, with the casinos contributing a base amount of money (called a seed). This ensures that even if you get a Jackpot result in a game right after someone else has won the Jackpot, you will still get a large win.</p>

			<p>Please note:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><p>In some games you have to make a specific bet to be eligible for the Jackpot.</p></li>
				<li><p>If you get disconnected in the middle of a game round, your game does not change the value of the Jackpot. The state of the game up to that point is remembered by the casino; the next time you log in you can finish your game round with the same odds and without placing a new bet.</p></li>
				<li><p>If a Jackpot is being discontinued (a game is closed and removed from the casino client), you will be notified of it by the casino.</p></li>
			</ul>

			<p>The Jackpot for this game works like this:</p>

			<dl>
				<dt>Seed (how much money the Jackpot starts out with):</dt>
				<dd>25 000 x your jackpot bet size.</dd>
				<dt>Contribution rate (what percentage of each bet goes into the Jackpot):</dt>
				<dd>12%</dd>
				<dt>Win condition (the result you have to get to win the Jackpot):</dt>
				<dd>Three darts in the bullseye or outer bull</dd>
				<dt>Win requirements (what you need to do to be eligible for the Jackpot):</dt>
				<dd>Place a bet on the jackpot result</dd>
			</dl>

			<p>In addition, the jackpot bet pays 20 times your bet if one dart hits the bullseye or outer bull, and 2000 times your bet if two darts hit the bullseye or outer bull.</p>
