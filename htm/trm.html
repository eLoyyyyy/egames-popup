			<p><strong>5-reel 30-line slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Thor The Mighty Avenger is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Line Bet</strong> to increase or decrease the amount.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X 30. This is due to the fact that the game Thor The Mighty Avenger is played using a fixed number of 30 active lines, no more, no less.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spins the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Mouse over the <strong>Auto Play</strong> button to display the list of options. Select the number of spins to be played automatically or choose <strong>Until Feature</strong> to spin until a Rainbow Bridge Feature is triggered. Clicking on an option starts the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. The Auto Play button changes into Stop during the Auto Play mode. The Auto Play mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player or when a Rainbow Bridge Feature is triggered if you chose <strong>Until Feature</strong>, or when you click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			</ul>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Thunderstorm Respin</strong> screen describes the conditions necessary to enter this feature and how it is played.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Lightning Free Spin</strong> screen describes the conditions necessary to enter this feature and the rules of its play.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Rainbow Bridge Feature</strong> screen explains how this feature is triggered and describes its options.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Jotunheim Free Games</strong> screen explains how this type of free games is played.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Jotunheim Free Games (Wild Laufey Feature)</strong> screen explains the behavior of the Laufey symbol during this feature.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Earth Free Games</strong> screen explains how this type of free games is played.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Earth Free Games (Scorching Multiplier Feature)</strong> screen explains the behavior of the Destroyer symbol during this feature.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Marvel Multi-Level Mystery Progressive Jackpot</strong> screen describes how to win entry to the Marvel Multi-Level Mystery Progressive Jackpot game that wins one of four jackpots, and explains the game&rsquo;s rules.</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paylines</strong> screen illustrates all possible payline combinations and explains the payout rules during main game.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Paylines In Free Games</strong> screen illustrates all possible payline combinations and explains the payout rules during Free Games.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>All 30 lines are active during the game.</li>
			<li>Paylines pay different during main game and during Free Games.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations can only be on an active payline, must start from the leftmost reel and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol <img src="../img/trm_wild.jpg" alt="" /> can stand for any other symbol, except Scatter <img src="../img/trm_scatter.jpg" alt="" />, the Destroyer <img src="../img/trm_destroyer.jpg" alt="" /> or the Laufey <img src="../img/trm_laufey.jpg" alt="" />symbols to make the best possible winning combination. There is also a separate payout for 3 or more Wild symbols on an active payline, as seen in the Paytable. This is paid out instead of the regular symbol win if the win amount from Wilds is larger than the win from the regular symbols (by Wild standing in).</p>
			<p>During main game, the Wild symbol appears stacked on reels 2 and 4 and may trigger the Thunderstorm Respin or Lightning Free Spin features. This means that the Wild symbols appear one on top of the other on those reels.</p>
			<p>During Free Games, Wild symbols may appear stacked as well as non-stacked on reel 3.</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols do not have to occur on any particular payline. If there are 3 or more Scatters in any position in the spin results, the payout earned is multiplied by the total bet and added to payline winnings.</p>
			<p>The Scatter symbol doesn&rsquo;t appear during Free Games.</p>
			<p><strong>Rainbow Bridge feature</strong></p>
			<p>The Thor The Mighty Avenger game has 3 different game modes: Asgard main game mode and 2 Free Games modes. Reel 3 entirely covered by Heimdall symbols <img src="../img/trm_heimdall.jpg" alt="" /> triggers the Rainbow Bridge feature.</p>
			<p>The game always starts in main mode. Once the feature has been triggered, player will be faced with a choice of two orbs. Picking one of the orbs will transport player to either: Jotunheim Free Games, Earth Free Games or return to Asgard Main Game.</p>
			<p>If triggered during the Auto Play mode, the feature begins after the player clicks on Click to Start. Then the player has to make a selection and after clicking, the Auto Play mode resumes automatically in main game mode or is temporarily interrupted if another mode is switched to and resumed when back to Asgard mode. If the Auto Play mode was activated via the &ldquo;Until Feature&rdquo; option, it is not resumed once back into the main game.</p>
			<p><strong>Thunderstorm Respin</strong></p>
			<p>Wild symbols covering the entire 2nd reel in the main game trigger the Thunderstorm feature.</p>
			<p>In the Thunderstorm feature, 1 respin is awarded, during which reel 2 is frozen and covered with Wilds. No other feature can be triggered during the Thunderstorm Respin.</p>
			<p>If triggered during the Auto Play mode, the feature begins after the player clicks on Click to Start or waits for a while. When the feature has been played, the Auto Play mode resumes automatically.</p>
			<p><strong>Lightning Free Spin</strong></p>
			<p>Wild appearing stacked on the entire 4th reel during the main game trigger the Lightning Free Spin feature, during which 2 to 5 Wilds are randomly distributed on the reels for the duration of 1 spin. No other feature can be triggered during that spin.</p>
			<p>If triggered during the Auto Play mode, the feature begins after the player clicks on Click to Start or waits for a while. When the feature has been played, the Auto Play mode resumes automatically.</p>
			<p><strong>JOTUNHEIM AND EARTH FREE GAMES MODES</strong></p>
			<p>Both types of Free Games are played on a special 5 reel grid where reels 2 and 4 are 3-symbols high, while the rest of the reels are only 2-symbols high.</p>
			<p>Once triggered, Free Games are played infinitely until interrupted by the Rainbow Bridge transition feature (Heimdall symbols covering the entire reel 3).</p>
			<p>Only Wild and Heimdall symbols appear on reel 3 during Free Games.</p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same bets per line as on the spin that triggered the Free Games. After each spin, the win is displayed in the Free Games Win field.</p>
			<p>The Autoplay mode cannot be used during Free Games. If Jotunheim or Earth Free Games are triggered during Autoplay through the Rainbow Bridge feature in main mode, the Autoplay session is interrupted to play the Free Games and then resumed when back to main game Asgard mode.</p>
			<p><strong>Jotunheim Free Games</strong></p>
			<p>The Laufey symbol appears only during Jotunheim Free Games mode and serves as an Extra Wild, replacing Wild symbols as well.</p>
			<p>Laufey participating in any winning combination will freeze that combination for the duration of the next spin guaranteeing the same win again or a better one.</p>
			<p>One and the same Laufey symbol can freeze combinations along different paylines. Laufey symbol that froze a combination in the current spin will not freeze the same payline while it remains in the same place. Only a new Laufey symbol can freeze a winning combination.</p>
			<p>If a Laufey symbol froze a combination and in the next spin it participates in another combination, that second combination will freeze only if it has a new Laufey symbol in it that didn&rsquo;t participate in the previous combination.</p>
			<p><strong>Earth Free Games</strong></p>
			<p>The Destroyer symbol appears only during Earth Free Games and expands to cover the entire reel 5. It blows fire on the 4th to 1st reels from right to left during which between 2 to 6 symbols will randomly catch fire. The symbols that randomly caught fire will burn for 1 to 4 spins. Each burning symbol doubles the multiplier of a winning combination it participates in. Once the Destroyer has finished burning the reels it retracts back to the original symbol position.</p>
			<p>If the Destroyer burns a symbol that is already burning, the number of spins for which that symbol will burn will increase but never exceed 4.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Marvel Mystery Jackpot</strong></p>
			<p>Marvel Mystery Jackpot is a multi-level progressive jackpot game that is available in all Marvel games and is linked to all Marvel games. A small percentage of each bet in the Marvel games, by every person playing this game in each of many online casinos, is added to the progressive jackpot.</p>
			<p>The trigger that starts the Jackpot game is random and can occur after any spin in any of the linked games. It is not caused by any symbol combination in the linked games and even a spin that does not win anything in the main game can trigger the Jackpot game. Likewise, any bet with any size in the linked games can trigger the Jackpot game. Nonetheless, the chances of triggering the Jackpot game increase or decrease proportionally to the bet size. Entering the Jackpot game guarantees a win of one of the four jackpots. Playing the Jackpot game reveals the jackpot that has been awarded to you, but does not determine it.</p>
			<p>There are four different levels of jackpots that you can win: Power Jackpot, Extra Power Jackpot, Super Power Jackpot and Ultimate Power Jackpot. Different types of jackpots hold different prize amounts. The jackpot gamescreen contains 20 squares which in the beginning of the gameplay are turned upside down. Clicking on a square will turn it around and reveal one of four jackpot symbols on the other side. Once you have found three matching symbols, you win the jackpot that corresponds to these symbols. Jackpot winnings are added to the main game winnings (if any) and are displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field together with any other winnings.</p>
			<p>The Marvel Mystery Jackpot game has a timeout timer. This means that if you do not pick a square in a set amount of time, you will automatically receive your prize.</p>
			<p>The Jackpot for this game works like this:</p>
			<table class="table">
			<tbody>
			<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>Seed</strong> (how much money the Jackpots start out with):</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Power: &euro;50<br />Extra Power: &euro;500<br />Super Power: &euro;5,000<br />Ultimate Power: &euro;100,000</p>
			</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>Contribution rate</strong> (what percentage of each bet goes into Jackpot):</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>0.99%</p>
			</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>Win condition</strong> (the result you have to get to win the Jackpot):</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Entering the jackpot game guarantees a win. Match 3 jackpot symbols of the corresponding Jackpot or wait for the timer to run out.</p>
			</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>Win requirements</strong> (what you need to do to be eligible for the Jackpot):</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Play a Marvel game.</p>
			</td>
			</tr>
			</tbody>
			</table>
			<p><strong>Please note:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>The seed and Jackpot values are in Euros in the progressive network and their value in your local currency is dependent on the currency exchange rate.</li>
			<li>The mechanics of Marvel Mystery Jackpot prohibit simultaneous jackpot winnings.</li>
			<li>Imperfections in the Internet connectivity may cause you to experience delays in Jackpot messages or updates, but they do not affect actual Jackpot wins.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 91.92%.</p>
