			<p><strong>5-Reel 25-line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of The Love Boat&trade; is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Line Bet</strong> to increase or decrease the amount.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X 25. This is due to the fact that the game The Love Boat&trade; is played using a fixed number of 25 active lines, no more, no less.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spins the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Mouse over the <strong>Auto Play</strong> button to display the list of options. Select the number of spins to be played automatically or choose Until Feature to spin until the Love Doctor Free Games, the Matchup Bonus or the Dream Cruise Jackpot is triggered. Clicking on an option starts the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. The Auto Play mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the Love Doctor Free Games, the Matchup Bonus or the Dream Cruise Jackpot is triggered if you chose Until Feature, or when you click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Clicking the <strong>Turbo Mode</strong> button switches on or off the Turbo Mode thus turning on or off some of the win animations and sounds, and making the reels spin faster or slower.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Matchup Bonus</strong> screen explains how this feature is triggered and how to play it.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Love Doctor Free Games</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to trigger the Free Games feature and describes its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Dream Cruise Jackpot</strong> screens explain how this feature is triggered and its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Paylines</strong> screen illustrates all paylines and explains the rules for calculating their wins.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels as illustrated on the <strong>Paylines</strong> screen of the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>All 25 active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the leftmost reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol <img src="../img/lvb_wild.jpg" alt="" /> can stand for any other symbol except for the Scatter, Bonus and Jackpot symbols to make the best possible winning combination. There is also a separate payout for 2 or more Wild symbols on an active payline, as seen in the Paytable. This is paid out instead of the regular symbol win if the win amount from Wilds is larger than the win from the regular symbols (by Wild standing in).</p>
			<p>A Freezing Wild symbol <img src="../img/lvb_frwild.jpg" alt="" /> is one of the special features in The Love Doctor Free Games and can stand for any other symbol except for the Scatter. More information can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols <img src="../img/lvb_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> do not have to occur on any particular payline. If there are 3 or more Scatters in any position in the spin results, the payout is multiplied by the total bet and added to the payline winnings, if any.</p>
			<p>In addition, 3 or more Scatters anywhere during the main game trigger The Love Doctor Free Games. More information on The Love Doctor Free Games can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Bonus symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Bonus symbol <img src="../img/lvb_bonus.jpg" alt="" /> may appear on reels 1, 3 and 5 during the main game only and triggers the Matchup Bonus when appearing anywhere on these 3 reels simultaneously.</p>
			<p>More information on the Matchup Bonus can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Jackpot symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Jackpot symbol <img src="../img/lvb_ticket.jpg" alt="" /> appears on reel 5 during the main game only and awards you a number of tickets which qualify for the recurrent jackpot draw.</p>
			<p>More information on the Dream Cruise Jackpot can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>The Love Doctor Free Games</strong></p>
			<p>3 or more <img src="../img/lvb_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> symbols, appearing simultaneously in any position on the reels during the main game, trigger The Love Doctor Free Games with special features.</p>
			<p>To start the feature, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong> in the lower right-hand corner of the game window.</p>
			<p>A message appears saying that you have won 10 Free Games. Shortly afterwards the feature begins.</p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same bet per line as on the spin that won the Free Games. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games. The <strong>Spin Multiplier</strong> field shows the current multiplier value. The number of free spins remaining is shown above the reels.</p>
			<p><img src="../img/lvb_bonus.jpg" alt="" /> and <img src="../img/lvb_ticket.jpg" alt="" /> symbols are not available during The Love Doctor Free Games.</p>
			<p>For each Dr. Love symbol <img src="../img/lvb_drlove.jpg" alt="" /> appearing on the reels, the love meter to the left of the reels rises 1 step higher. That is, if 2 Dr. Love symbols appear after a spin, the love meter rises 2 steps higher, etc. Once level 10 of the meter is reached, it does not rise any more even if Dr. Love appears on the reels.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> The meter only rises at the end of a spin.</p>
			<p>You start the Free Games with the love meter on level 0. Depending on which level you have reached, you are either awarded a special feature or the free spins continue normally, without any special features or with the previously accumulated features. Below are the love meter levels which award special features:</p>
			<table class="table"><colgroup><col width="110" /><col width="330" /></colgroup>
			<tbody>
			<tr><th><strong><span style="font-family: verdana;">Love meter level</span></strong></th><th><strong><span style="font-family: verdana;">Award</span></strong></th></tr>
			<tr>
			<td>Level 2</td>
			<td>1 <img src="../img/lvb_frwild.jpg" alt="" />, which will remain in the same position for the rest of the Free Games round</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>Level 4</td>
			<td>A random additional number of free spins &ndash; 2, 3, 4 or 5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>Level 6</td>
			<td>A random number of <img src="../img/lvb_frwild.jpg" alt="" /> (either 1 or 2), which will remain frozen until the end of the Free Games round</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>Level 8</td>
			<td>A random additional number of free spins &ndash; 2, 3, 4 or 5</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>Level 10</td>
			<td>2 additional free spins and a random multiplier (X2 or X3); all subsequent Free Games wins will be multiplied by that multiplier value</td>
			</tr>
			</tbody>
			</table>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> A <img src="../img/lvb_frwild.jpg" alt="" /> cannot occur where such a symbol has already occurred, i.e. it cannot replace an already existing one. The number of symbols awarded by reaching Level 6 will be added to the symbol already won from Level 2 (since features won during The Love Doctor Free Games are accumulated). This means that if you have reached Level 6 and win 1 <img src="../img/lvb_frwild.jpg" alt="" />, you will continue the Free Games with a total of 2 <img src="../img/lvb_frwild.jpg" alt="" /> symbols. Respectively, if Level 6 awards you 2 <img src="../img/lvb_frwild.jpg" alt="" /> symbols, you will continue the Free Games with a total of 3 <img src="../img/lvb_frwild.jpg" alt="" /> symbols.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> A feature is awarded from the next spin onwards and does not affect the current spin.</p>
			<p>Levels 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 of the love meter do not award features but accumulated features will still be valid.</p>
			<p>It is possible to gain up to 5 Dr. Love symbols in a single spin thus winning 3 features on the same spin.</p>
			<p>3 or more Scatters appearing anywhere on the reels pay according to the paytable, but cannot re-trigger the Free Games.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is possible for a Scatter or a Dr. Love symbol to be covered by a Freezing Wild. When a Freezing Wild covers a Scatter, any winning combinations which the Scatter participates in will still be paid. When a Dr. Love symbol is covered by a Freezing Wild, it raises the love meter, and is also considered a Wild. </p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the main game spin that won the Free Games. <strong>Feature win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up).</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game. When returning to the main game reels, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize. Free Game wins are added to the payline wins.</p>
			<p><strong>Matchup Bonus</strong></p>
			<p>If a Bonus symbol <img src="../img/lvb_bonus.jpg" alt="" /> appears on reels 1, 3 and 5 simultaneously during the main game, the <strong>Matchup Bonus</strong> is triggered.</p>
			<p>To start the feature, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong> in the lower right-hand corner of the game window.</p>
			<p>In the Matchup Bonus, the player picks a chick from the group on the left and a dude from the group on the right to win cash prizes and a multiplier.</p>
			<p>The group of 6 gentlemen awards a cash prize of 2 to 6 times the total bet of the spin that triggered the feature and the group of 6 ladies may award a cash prize of 3 to 6 times the total bet of the spin that triggered the Bonus. The total Bonus win will be the sum of both picks times the awarded multiplier. The more successful the match is, the higher the multiplier won:</p>
			<p>- &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just be friends&rdquo; (X1 multiplier)</p>
			<p>- &ldquo;You&rsquo;re smoking hot&rdquo; (X3 multiplier)</p>
			<p>- &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my one true love&rdquo; (X5 multiplier)</p>
			<p>If the Matchup Bonus is triggered during the Auto Play mode, the feature begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. Next, the player makes the necessary picks on the left and on the right. Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> on the screen summarizing the bonus wins resumes the Auto Play mode. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p><strong>Dream Cruise Jackpot</strong></p>
			<p>The <strong>Dream Cruise Jackpot</strong> is a recurrent jackpot and whenever won it awards &euro;10,000 to the player whose ticket is drawn in the raffle.</p>
			<p>When the Jackpot symbol <img src="../img/lvb_ticket.jpg" alt="" /> appears anywhere on reel 5 during the main game, you will be awarded a random number of tickets. The higher your bet, the more tickets you will win.</p>
			<p>Your tickets enter a raffle which takes place at a fixed day and time. The exact day and time of the next raffle are shown to the right of the reels.</p>
			<p>If 1 of your tickets is drawn in the raffle, you win a fixed prize of &euro;10,000.</p>
			<p>Clicking the <strong>My tickets</strong> button to the right of the reels takes you to a screen, where you can find information on your current tickets and see your ticket history. Clicking <strong>Close</strong> in the right-hand corner of this screen takes you back to the reels.</p>
			<p>Clicking the <strong>Info</strong> button to the right of the reels takes you directly to the <strong>Dream Cruise Jackpot</strong> screen of the info pages, where the feature is described.</p>
			<p>If you win the jackpot, a message appears, saying that you have won. Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> on this message takes you back to the reels.</p>
			<p>If the raffle takes place while you are not online, but your ticket wins, you will be notified via a pop-up message once you log back into the casino.</p>
			<p>The jackpot raffle can be won even if you are not currently playing the game. In case you are logged into the casino, but are not currently playing The Love Boat, you will still be notified via a casino message if you win the jackpot.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 93.98%.</p>
