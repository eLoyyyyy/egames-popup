			<p><strong>5-Reel Multiline Slots</strong></p>

			<p>The object of Captain's Treasure is to obtain a winning symbol combination by spinning the reels.</p>

			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Choose the amount you wish to bet on each payline, by clicking on the <strong>+</strong> and <strong>&emdash;</strong> buttons on the bottom of the screen.</li>
				<li>Select the number of paylines you want to bet on by clicking on the <strong>Bet One</strong> button or the line numbers to the left or right of the reels. When you click on line number 3 for example, you also select lines 1 and 2. Each click on the <strong>Bet One</strong> button selects one more line. Click <strong>Bet Max</strong> or line number 9 to select all paylines. Remember that your total bet (the amount you spend on the game round) is the line bet multiplied by the number of lines selected. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> will also spin the reels automatically.</li>
				<li>Click <strong>Spin</strong> (if you did not press <strong>Bet Max</strong>) to spin the reels.</li>
				<li>If the reels show a winning combination after they stop (along a payline you bet on), you win according to the paytable. Click the <strong>Paytable</strong> button to see the paytable, if you wish. Close the paytable by clicking the <strong>Paytable</strong> button again. If you win on multiple paylines simultaneously, your winnings are added up.</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>

			<p>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels. You can activate paylines and see their shape by progressively clicking the <strong>Bet One </strong>button.</p>

			<p><strong>Please note:</strong> You only win if a combination occurs on an active payline. The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>

			<p><strong>About the paytable:</strong></p>

			<p>The paytable shows a value for every hit amount for each symbol. For example, if you have four consecutive symbols starting on the leftmost or rightmost reel (that is four hits), the win amount is determined by multiplying the line bet value by the number displayed on the paytable for four of that particular symbol. If you have winning combinations on multiple paylines, add them all up to get the total win amount. The symbols must be consecutive, starting from the leftmost or rightmost reel, to qualify as hits. In case one payline contains two winning combinations (for example: two anchors counted from the left and three swords counted from the right), you are paid for both combinations. Five symbols in a row are only paid once.</p>

			<p><strong>Please note:</strong> There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much you're betting on a single payline. The total bet shows how much you're spending in this game round. The payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet, not by the total bet. If you get winning combinations on more than one payline, the winnings for each payline are added up.</p>

			<p>The Captain symbol is a wild symbol &mdash; meaning it can substitute for any other symbol (including the scatter symbol), like a joker in card games. Also, the wild symbol doubles any win in the combination it is in, but not cumulatively (that is, the win will be multiplied by 2 regardless of the number of wild symbols contained in the winning combination).The Captain symbol appears on reels 2, 3 and 4 only.</p>

			<p><strong>Scatter symbol:</strong></p>

			<p>The Treasure Chest symbol is a scatter symbol &mdash; when 2 to 5 of these symbols appear on the screen, you are paid according to the number shown on the paytable (a scatter win is calculated by multiplying the number on the respective row of the scatter paytable with your TOTAL bet amount, not just the line bet). The symbols must be consecutive, starting from the leftmost or rightmost reel, to qualify as hits. They don't have to follow any payline. Scatter wins are added to payline wins (if you don't have any payline wins, you are only paid the scatter win).</p>

			<p><strong>Dollar Ball</strong></p>

			<p>This is a lotto-type progressive sidegame where you pick 5 numbers out of 49. Then once you start the main game, five numbers will be drawn randomly. The more numbers match your selection, the more you win. If all five numbers match, you win the Jackpot.</p>

			<p>Dollar Ball resides in the top right part of the screen. Click <strong>Enable</strong> to play it. You will see a set of numbers, from 1 to 49. Click on any five of them to select manually (click again to deselect), or click on <strong>Random pick</strong> to have it done for you automatically. If you want to change the selected numbers, click on any of the already selected numbers to uncheck them, and then click the new ones. Click<strong>Activate</strong> to hide the numbers and confirm your selection. While the Dollar Ball is activated, an additional Jackpot bet is automatically made each time you make a bet in the main game. The value of the Jackpot bet is fixed and you can find it in the Dollar Ball interface. If you want to cancel the Dollar Ball game, click <strong>Disable</strong>.</p>

			<p>Dollar Ball will be played along with every main game round, with the same numbers, until you either change the numbers or disable the sidegame.</p>

			<p>Your numbers will be shown in a row of white circles at the top of the screen. Once you start a round of the main game, the drawn numbers will appear just above them. If any of the numbers match your selection, the circles containing these numbers will change color to green and your win amount will appear below. It will be added to your balance along with any winnings from the main game round. Dollar Ball wins are paid according to the paytable for Dollar Ball which can be found in the main game paytable. Wins received from 1, 2, or 3 correct numbers are fixed wins and their winning amounts calculated by multiplying the Jackpot bet by the corresponding multiplier.</p>

			<p>In addition to the fixed wins, the Dollar Ball includes progressive wins. A small percentage of each Jackpot bet is added to the common pot by every person playing this game. When a player gets the right result (the five numbers selected match the five numbers drawn), that player wins the entire Jackpot. It is also possible to win part of the Jackpot (1% of the Jackpot) if four out of the five numbers selected match four of the numbers drawn.</p>

			<p>After a Jackpot has been won, a new pot is started, with the casino contributing a base amount of money (called a seed). This ensures that even if you get a Jackpot result in a game right after someone else has won the Jackpot, you will still get a large win.</p>

			<p>Please note:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You have to make a Jackpot bet to be eligible for the Jackpot.</li>
				<li>You do not have to win the main game round to win the Jackpot.</li>
				<li>The Jackpot contribution applies only when you play with the Dollar Ball enabled.</li>
				<li>All paytable wins and multipliers for the Dollar Ball game correspond to the Jackpot bet only.</li>
				<li>If a Jackpot is being discontinued (a game is closed and removed from the casino client), you will be notified of it by the casino.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Jackpot for this game works like this:</p>
			<table class="table">
				<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>Seed (how much money the Jackpot starts out with):</strong></td>
					<td>10,000 x Jackpot bet.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>Contribution rate (what percentage of each Jackpot bet goes into the Jackpot):</strong></td>
					<td>10%</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>Win condition (the result you have to get to win the Jackpot):</strong></td>
					<td>Catch 5 balls.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>Win requirements (what you need to do to be eligible for the Jackpot):</strong></td>
					<td>Place the Jackpot bet.</td>
				</tr>
				</tbody>
