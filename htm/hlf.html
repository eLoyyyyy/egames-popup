			<p><strong>5-Reel 20-line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Halloween Fortune is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Line Bet</strong> and on top of the pictures of stones to increase or decrease the amount.</li>
			<li>Paylines are chosen by clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Lines</strong> and on top of the pictures of leaves. Each click activates/deactivates a payline. When all paylines are activated, clicking the button again resets it to one active payline. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the currently selected bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spin the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Mouse over the <strong>Auto Play</strong> button to display the list of options. Select the number of spins to be played automatically or choose <strong>Until Feature</strong> to spin until the Witches' Brew Bonus is triggered. Clicking on an option starts the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. The <strong>Auto Play</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Play mode. The<strong>Auto Play</strong> mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the Witches' Brew Bonus is triggered if you chose <strong>Until Feature</strong>, or when you click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are added up together.</li>
			<li>In the case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings.</li>
			<li>Any win below the Gamble feature limit can activate the <strong>Gamble</strong> button which, when clicked, starts the Gamble feature. More information about the Gamble feature can be found below.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Paylines</strong> screen illustrates all possible paylines and explains the rules for calculating their wins.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Witches' Brew Bonus</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to enter the Witches' Brew Bonus feature and describes its rules as well as the Free Games rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Gamble</strong> screen describes how to try doubling winnings by gambling with them and describes the doubling-up rules.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels. Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking + or - below <strong>Lines</strong>.</li>
			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations can only be on an active payline, must start from the leftmost reel and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol <img src="../img/hlf_wild.jpg" alt="" /> can stand for any other symbol, except Scatter and Bonus, to make the best possible winning combination. There is also a separate payout for two or more Wild symbols on an active payline, as seen in the Paytable. This is paid out instead of the regular symbol win if the win amount from Wild is larger than the win from the regular symbols (by Wild standing in).</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols <img src="../img/hlf_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> do not have to occur on any particular payline. If there are three or more Scatter in any position in the spin results, the payout earned is multiplied by the total bet and added to payline winnings.</p>
			<p><strong>Bonus Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Bonus symbols <img src="../img/hlf_bonus.jpg" alt="" /> can appear only on reels 1 and 5. When they appear in any position on these reels simultaneously, the Witches' Brew Bonus game is triggered.</p>
			<p><strong>Witches' Brew Bonus</strong></p>
			<p>To start the Witches' Brew Bonus, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>.</p>
			<p>The player is presented a screen with 3 witches to choose from. Click on a witch to make a selection. Every selection wins a number of Free Games (3, 4, 5, 7, 10 or 20). Click on <strong>Continue</strong> to proceed.</p>
			<p>On the next screen the player has to select a potion out of 6, to win a multiplier (2, 3, 4, 5, 7 or 10) for the Free Games. A multiplier during Free Games means that all wins during Free Games are multiplied by that number. Click on a potion to make a selection. Then click <strong>Continue</strong> to proceed to the Free Games round. The Free Games begin automatically.</p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same number of lines and bets per line as on the spin that won the Free Games round. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>If Bonus symbols appear on reels 1 and 5 simultaneously during Free Games, in any position, a random number of additional Free Games is won (3, 4, 5, 7, 10 or 20), with the same multiplier.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the spin that won the Free Games. <strong>Feature Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total Win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up).</p>
			<p>If there were no wins in the main game spin that triggered the Bonus, then only Total Win will be showed on the result board.</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p>If the Witches' Brew Bonus is triggered during the Auto Play mode, the feature begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. The player has to select a witch and click on <strong>Continue</strong>, and then select a potion and click on <strong>Continue</strong> again to start the Free Games. When the Witches' Brew Bonus is over, click <strong>Continue</strong> to begin the Free Games. When the Free Games are over, click <strong>Continue</strong> on the screen summarizing the Bonus win. You will be taken to the main game reels and the Auto Play mode will resume automatically. When returning to the reels, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p><strong>Gamble</strong></p>
			<p>A win activates the <strong>Gamble</strong> button which, when clicked, starts the Gamble feature where you can bet the winnings from your last spin to try and increase them.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Your current winnings are shown in the <strong>Bank</strong> field. You can choose to bet these winnings to double them by clicking <strong>Red</strong> or <strong>Black</strong>button. <strong>Double To</strong> shows the amount that will be placed in the <strong>Bank</strong>, if you win.</p>
			<p>If you do not want to bet, you can click <strong>Collect</strong> to add the winnings from the last spin to your balance and return to the main game. If you choose to bet, you have to guess whether the next card that is going to be revealed is red or black. If your guess is correct, you win. If your guess is wrong, you lose your bet and the Gamble feature ends.</p>
			<p>With every win, you can bet again until the winnings in the <strong>Bank</strong> are equal to or greater than the Gamble feature limit. The limit is shown on the <strong>Info</strong> page that describes the Gamble feature.</p>
			<p>Click <strong>Collect</strong> to add your winnings from the <strong>Bank</strong> to your balance and return to the main game.</p>
			<p><strong>Please note:</strong> The <strong>Gamble</strong> button is disabled during Free Games and while the <strong>Auto Play</strong> is active.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 97.06%.</p>
