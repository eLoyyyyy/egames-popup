			<p><strong>5-Reel with All-Ways Feature</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Lucky Panda is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Coin values are chosen by clicking + and &ndash; under <strong>Coin</strong>. Each click on + increases in different steps the coin value. When the maximum is reached, the player can decrease it by progressively clicking on the &ndash; button below <strong>Coin</strong>.</li>
			<li>The number of ways in the All-Ways feature can be chosen by progressively clicking the + and &ndash; buttons below <strong>Ways</strong> to switch between 5 set levels. Clicking the + button activates one more reel and doubles the number of ways. Clicking the &ndash; button deactivates one reel and reduces the number of ways in half. More information about the All-Ways feature can be found below.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = coin value X bet multiplier.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all 1024 ways with the current coin value and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spins the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Clicking Spin spins the reels with the current selection of active reels and bets.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Mouse over the <strong>Auto Play</strong> button to display the list of options. Select the number of spins to be played automatically or choose &lsquo;Until Feature&rsquo; to spin until the Free Games round is triggered. Clicking on an option starts the Auto Play function. The <strong>Auto Play</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Play mode. The Auto Play mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when a Free Games round is triggered if you chose &lsquo;Until Feature&rsquo;, or when you click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Combination win = coin X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>In the case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>The way wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			</ul>

			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the payout must be multiplied by the coin value.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the leftmost reel, and the symbols have to be on adjacent reels.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Maximum Win Limit</strong></p>
			<p>The maximum win in the game has an upper limit. For more information, see the Terms and Conditions section.</p>
			<p><strong>All-Ways Feature</strong></p>
			<p>The game is played in the All-Ways feature. The player bets on combinations of adjacent symbols between active reels, and not paylines, beginning with the leftmost reel.</p>
			<p>When activated on all five reels, any combination of symbols on adjacent reels from left to right, beginning with the leftmost reel, will pay regardless of the symbol position on the reel.</p>
			<p>When activating less than 5 reels, each non activated reel will have only its two centre positions participating in the forming of the win combinations.</p>

			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p>Click on + or &ndash; below <strong>Ways</strong> button to define the number of ways to be activated in the All-Ways feature.</p>
			<p>Click the <strong>Bet Max</strong> button to play the game with the maximum number of ways.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol <img src="../img/gts51_wild.jpg" alt="" /> appears only on reels 2, 3 and 4. It can stand for any other symbol, except Scatter, to make the best possible winning combination.</p>
			<p>Wild symbol combinations do not pay separately.</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols <img src="../img/gts51_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> do not have to occur in a particular combination. Three or more Scatters in any position in the spin results, during main game pay separately. Note that if a Scatter appears on a part of the reel that is inactive, it is still counted.</p>
			<p>If three or more Scatter symbols appear in any position on the reels simultaneously during main game, 15 Free Games are triggered.</p>
			<p>If three or more Scatter symbols appear in any position on the reels simultaneously during Free Games, the Free Games feature is retriggered, as explained <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
			<p>If there are two Scatters dispersed on the reels during main game only, the Second Chance Scatter feature is triggered. More information about the Second Chance Scatter feature can be found <a href="../img/gts51.html#second_chance_scatter_section">here</a>.</p>
			<p><strong><a name="second_chance_scatter_section"></a>Second Chance Scatter Feature</strong></p>
			<p>The Second Chance Scatter feature can be triggered only during main game when two and only two Scatter symbols appear anywhere on the reels. The player is then rewarded with a free re-spin, during which the two reels, where the Scatters that have won the free spin are positioned, freeze, and the other three reels are spun again. The re-spin allows for more wins as well as another chance of getting the third scatter and triggering free games. All wins are paid both after the spin that triggered the 2<sup>nd</sup> chance, and after the 2<sup>nd</sup> chance spin.</p>
			<p><strong><a name="free_games_section"></a>Free Games</strong></p>
			<p>Three or more Scatters in any position on the reels simultaneously during main game trigger 15 Free Games with all reel wins doubled. The same number of active reels that triggered the Free Games, will be featured during free games spins.</p>
			<p>Three or more Scatters in any position on the reels simultaneously during Free Games win 15 more Free Games, in which the same rules are applied. In each Free Games round the Free Games can be retriggered to a maximum number of 210. Second Chance Scatter feature does not apply during Free Games.</p>
			<p>To start the Free Games, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. A message appears saying that a Free Games round follows. After a while the Free Games begin automatically.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same number of coin value and ways as on the spin that won the Free Games. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the spin that won the free games. <strong>Feature win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total win</strong> shows the aggregate winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up).</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p>If Free Games are triggered during the Auto Play mode, the feature begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. When all Free Games have been played and the player clicks <strong>Continue</strong> on the screen summarizing the Free Games win, the Auto Play mode resumes. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 95.50%.</p>
