			<p><strong>5-reel 20-line slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Secrets of the Amazon&trade; is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking + and - below <strong>Line Bet</strong> to increase or decrease the amount.</li>
			<li>Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Lines</strong>. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the currently selected bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spin the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Mouse over the <strong>Auto Play</strong> button to display the list of options. Select the number of spins to be played automatically or choose <strong>Until Feature</strong> to spin until the Moonflower Bonus and then the Moonlight Free Games round are triggered. Clicking on an option starts the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. The <strong>Auto Play</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong>during the Auto Play mode. The Auto Play mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the Moonflower Bonus and then the Moonlight Free Games round are triggered if you chose <strong>Until Feature</strong>, or when you click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Clicking the <strong>Turbo Mode</strong> button switches on or off the Turbo Mode thus turning on or off some of the win animations and sounds, and making the reels spin faster or slower.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In the case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Moonflower Bonus</strong> screen describes the symbol combination that triggers the bonus round and explains its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Moonlight Free Games</strong> screen explains how the feature is triggered and what its rules are.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Paylines</strong> screen illustrates all possible payline combinations and explains the payout rules in the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels as illustrated in the <strong>Paylines</strong> screen of the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round.Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the left most reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol <img src="../img/samz_wild.jpg" alt="" /> can stand for any other symbol, except <img src="../img/samz_scatter.jpg" alt="" />, to make the best possible winning combination.</p>
			<p>There is also a separate payout for 2 or more <img src="../img/samz_wild.jpg" alt="" /> on an active payline, as seen in the Paytable. This is paid out instead of the regular symbol win if the win amount from Wilds is larger than the win from the regular symbols (by Wild standing in).</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> Whenever <img src="../img/samz_wild.jpg" alt="" /> participates in a winning combination along an active payline while substituting for any symbol other than <img src="../img/samz_scatter.jpg" alt="" />, it will double the payout, but will not accumulate it, that is, 2 Wild symbols still multiply the win by 2 but not by 4. Also, the payout for 2 or more <img src="../img/samz_wild.jpg" alt="" /> will not be doubled either during main game, or Free Games.</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols <img src="../img/samz_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> do not have to occur on any particular payline and appear on the reels both during main game and the Moonlight Free Games.</p>
			<p>If 3 or more <img src="../img/samz_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> appear in any position on the reels during main game, the payout earned is multiplied by the total bet and added to payline winnings, if any. In addition, the Moonflower Bonus round is triggered as explained <a href="../img/samz.html#samz_MoonflowerBonus">here</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> 5x <img src="../img/samz_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> pay differently during main game and during the Moonlight Free Games, as displayed in the Paytable.</p>
			<p><a name="samz_MoonflowerBonus"></a><strong>Moonflower Bonus</strong></p>
			<p>3 or more <img src="../img/samz_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> appearing anywhere on the reels simultaneously during main game, trigger the Moonflower Bonus. The screen that follows displays 3 moonflowers. Pick any of them by clicking on it to reveal the number of Free Games that will follow. More information about the Moonlight Free Games round can be found <a href="../img/samz.html#samz_MoonlightFG">here</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> The more <img src="../img/samz_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> triggered the Moonflower Bonus, the higher the range of Free Games initially awarded, as shown below:</p>
			<table class="table">
			<tbody>
			<tr><th><strong><span style="font-family: verdana;">Number of symbols</span></strong></th><th><strong><span style="font-family: verdana;">Range of Free Games</span></strong></th></tr>
			<tr>
			<td><center>3x <img src="../img/samz_scatter.jpg" alt="" /></center></td>
			<td><center>5-15 initial Free Games</center></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td><center>4x <img src="../img/samz_scatter.jpg" alt="" /></center></td>
			<td><center>8-18 initial Free Games</center></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td><center>5x <img src="../img/samz_scatter.jpg" alt="" /></center></td>
			<td><center>10-20 initial Free Games</center></td>
			</tr>
			</tbody>
			</table>
			<p><a name="samz_MoonlightFG"></a><strong>Moonlight Free Games</strong></p>
			<p>The Moonlight Free Games start automatically and immediately after the Moonflower Bonus has ended.</p>
			<p>The Free Games round starts with an initial multiplier of x1. Each subsequent spin increases the multiplier progressively in steps of +1. For example, the 2<sup>nd</sup> Free Games spin will apply a multiplier of x2, the 3<sup>rd</sup> one x3, etc.</p>
			<p>Whenever <img src="../img/samz_wild.jpg" alt="" /> doubles any winning payline results during Free Games, the wins will be added to possibly other wins from the same Free Games spin and will be multiplied by the current Free Games spin multiplier. However, whenever a 5OAK winning combination of Wild symbols occurs, its payout will not be multiplied by the current Free Games multiplier.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> 3 or more <img src="../img/samz_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> appearing simultaneously during the Moonlight Free Games add the same number of Free Games that was initially won to the remaining ones. The maximum number of Free Games that can be played during one and the same Free Games round is 50. The maximum multiplier during one and the same Free Games round that can be reached is x50. Even though you may have re-triggered more than 50 Free Games altogether throughout the same Free Games round, the Free Games round will end when you spin the reels for the 50th time.</p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same number of lines and bets per line as on the spin that won the Free Games round. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games. </p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the spin that won the Free Games. <strong>Feature Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total Win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up). </p>
			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize. </p>
			<p>If the Free Games have been triggered during the Auto Play mode, the Free Games round begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. When all Free Games have been played and the player clicks <strong>Continue</strong> on the screen summarizing the Free Games win, the Auto Play mode resumes. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize. </p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 95.30%.</p>
