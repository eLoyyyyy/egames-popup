			<p><strong>8-Line Slots with a Progressive Jackpot</strong></p>
			<p>The object of Gold Rally is to obtain a winning symbol combination by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p>To play the game:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Select the number of paylines you want to bet on by clicking on the <strong>Bet One</strong> button or the line number on the upper and left edge of the reels. When you click on line number 5 for example, you also select lines 1-4. Each click on the <strong>Bet One</strong> buttons selects one more line. Click <strong>Bet Max</strong> or line number 8 to select all paylines. Remember that your total bet (the amount you spend on the game round) is line bet multiplied by the number of lines selected. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> also spins the reels automatically.</li>
			<li>Click <strong>Spin</strong> (if you did not press <strong>Bet Max</strong>) to spin the reels.</li>
			<li>If the reels show a winning combination after they stop (along a payline you bet on), you win according to the winning table. Click the <strong>Paytable</strong> button to see the paytable, if you wish. Close the paytable by clicking the <strong>Paytable</strong> button again. If you win on multiple paylines simultaneously, your winnings are added up.</li>
			</ul>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<p>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels. You can activate paylines and see their shape by progressively clicking the <strong>Bet One </strong>button.</p>
			<p><strong>Please note:</strong> You only win if a combination occurs on an active payline. The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p>The Bonus round symbol and the Scatter symbol are exceptions to that rule. Read more about the Scatter symbol and Bonus round symbol below.</p>
			<p><strong>About the winning tables:</strong></p>
			<p>The tables show a certain number for every symbol combination that pays. Multiply your line bet by that number and you get the winning amount. If you have winning combinations on multiple lines, add them all up to get the winning amount. Please note, that the one Horseshoe symbol combination and two Horseshoes symbol combination have to start on the leftmost or upmost reel (depending on the payline) to win.</p>
			<p><strong>Please note:</strong> There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much you're betting on a single payline. The total bet shows how much you're spending in this game round. The payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet, not by the total bet. If you get winning combinations on more than one payline, the winnings for each payline are added up.</p>
			<p><strong>Bonus round:</strong></p>
			<p>When you enter a bonus round, follow the instructions on the screen. You will be paid a prize according to the choice(s) you make. The &ldquo;You win&rdquo; sign shows your total win &ndash; if you play several rounds, wins from all rounds of the current bonus game are added up. After the bonus round, you can check the Game History, where each round&rsquo;s winning is shown on a separate line.</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter symbol:</strong></p>
			<p>The scales symbol is a scatter symbol &ndash; when you get 5 to 9 of these symbols on the screen, you are paid according to the table shown on the winnings table. Scatter win is calculated by multiplying the number on the respective row of the scatter paytable with your total bet. The symbols don&rsquo;t have to follow any payline. Scatter wins are added to payline wins (if you have any).</p>
			<p><strong>Progressive Jackpot:</strong></p>
			<p>A certain percentage of every bet you make goes to the progressive jackpot pool. You win the jackpot if you get 9 Scatter symbols on the screen, while playing for the maximum bet.</p>
			<p><strong>Jackpot</strong></p>
			<p>One of the possible wins in this game is the progressive Jackpot, built up by all the casinos that offer the game. A small percentage of each bet, by every person playing this game in each of many online casinos, is added to a common pot. When a player gets the right result, that player wins the entire Jackpot (in some games you can also win part of it).</p>
			<p>After a Jackpot has been won, a new pot is started, with the casinos contributing a base amount of money (called a seed). This ensures that even if you get a Jackpot result in a game right after someone else has won the Jackpot, you will still get a large win.</p>
			<p><strong>Please note:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>In some games you have to make a specific bet to be eligible for the Jackpot.</li>
			<li>If you get disconnected in the middle of a game round, your game does not change the value of the Jackpot. The state of the game up to that point is remembered by the casino; the next time you log in you can finish your game round with the same odds and without placing a new bet.</li>
			<li>If a Jackpot is being discontinued (a game is closed and removed from the casino client), you will be notified of it by the casino.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>The Jackpot for this game works like this:</p>
			<table class="table">
			<tbody>
			<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>Seed (how much money the Jackpot starts out with):</strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>37 500 x coin size</p>
			</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>Contribution rate (what percentage of each bet goes into the Jackpot):</strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>2%</p>
			</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>Win condition (the result you have to get to win the Jackpot):</strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Nine scale symbols.</p>
			</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>Win requirements (what you need to do to be eligible for the Jackpot):</strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Play for max bet.</p>
			</td>
			</tr>
			</tbody>
			</table>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 97.01%.</p>
