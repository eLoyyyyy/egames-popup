			<p><strong>5-reel 25-line slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Fortunes Of The Fox is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking + and - below <strong>Line Bet</strong> to increase or decrease the amount.</li>
			<li>Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Lines</strong>. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the currently selected bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spin the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Mouse over the <strong>Auto Play</strong> button to display the list of options. Select the number of spins to be played automatically or choose <strong>Until Feature</strong> to spin until the Lucky Grapes Bonus or Bonfire Free Games are triggered. Clicking on an option starts the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. The <strong>Auto Play</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Play mode. The Auto Play mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the Lucky Grapes Bonus or Bonfire Free Games are triggered if you chose <strong>Until Feature</strong>, or when you click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Clicking the <strong>Turbo Mode</strong> button switches on or off the Turbo Mode thus turning on or off some of the win animations and sounds, and making the reels spin faster or slower.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are added up together.</li>
			<li>In case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			</ul>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Bonfire Free Games</strong> screen describes how the feature is triggered and what its rules are.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Lucky Grapes Bonus</strong> screen explains the symbol combination that triggers the bonus round and also its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Paylines</strong> screen illustrates all possible payline combinations and explains the payout rules in the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels as illustrated in the <strong>Paylines</strong> screen of the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the left most reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol <img src="../img/fxf_wild.jpg" alt="" /> appears on reels #2, #3 and #4 both during main game and the Free Games and can stand for all symbols, other than <img src="../img/fxf_scatter.jpg" alt="" />, to make the best possible winning combinations.</p>
			<p>3 <img src="../img/fxf_wild.jpg" alt="" /> appearing anywhere on these reels during main game trigger the Bonfire Free Games. More information on the free games round can be found <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Wild combinations have no payout of their own.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Scatter Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols <img src="../img/fxf_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> do not have to occur on any particular payline and appear both during main game and the Free Games.</p>
			<p>2 or more <img src="../img/fxf_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> appearing during main game multiply the payout by the total bet and add it to any possible payline winnings, as shown in the Paytable.</p>
			<p>In addition, 3 or more <img src="../img/fxf_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> appearing simultaneously anywhere on the reels trigger the Lucky Grapes Bonus, as explained below.</p>
			<p><strong>Lucky Grapes Bonus</strong></p>
			<p>The Lucky Grapes Bonus is triggered by the simultaneous appearance of 3 or more <img src="../img/fxf_scatter.jpg" alt="" />.</p>
			<p>To start the Bonus round click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>.</p>

Foxy will then jump on her trampoline to get at the grapes, each grape collected awards a bonus cash prize until the trampoline breaks down. During a bonus round Foxy cannot jump more than 6 times winning 6 cash prizes respectively. If you have been awarded less than 6 cash prizes before the trampoline breaks down, a consolation prize will be awarded as well.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>If the Lucky Grapes Bonus has been triggered during the Bonfire Free Games, the free games are interrupted for the bonus to take place and resume after it has been played out.</li>

			<p>3 <img src="../img/fxf_wild.jpg" alt="" /> appearing simultaneously anywhere on these reels during the Bonfire Free Games retrigger 15 more free games with X3 Multiplier. In this way the Bonfire Free Games can be infinitely retriggered.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Any winnings occurring from the Lucky Grapes Bonus if triggered during the Bonfire Free Games, will be added to your free games winnings but will not be tripled.</li>
			</ul>
			<p> </p>

After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
