			<p><strong>5-Reel 25-line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of The Jazz Club is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking <strong>Bet per Line</strong>. Each click adds a coin to the line bet. When the maximum amount is reached, clicking the button again resets the line bet.</li>
			<li>Paylines are chosen by clicking <strong>Lines</strong>. Each click activates a payline. When all paylines are activated, clicking the button again resets it to one active payline. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the currently selected bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spins the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Start</strong> function. Clicking + or &ndash; above <strong>Auto Start</strong> selects the successive number of spins to be enabled. Clicking <strong>Auto Start</strong> spins the reels. The <strong>Auto Start</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Start mode of reelspin. The Auto Start mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the player clicks <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are added up together.</li>
			<li>In the case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Jazz Solo Bonus</strong> screen describes the necessary combination of symbols to enter the Bonus round and describes the bonus round rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Paylines</strong> screen illustrates all possible payline combinations.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels. Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking <strong>Lines</strong>.</li>
			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the left most reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Maximum Win Limit</strong></p>
			<p>The maximum win in the game has an upper limit. For more information, see the Terms and Conditions section.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol <img src="../img/gtsjzc_wild.jpg" alt="" /> appears only on reels 2, 3 and 4. It can stand for any other symbol, except Scatter, to make the best possible winning combination.</p>
			<p>Wild symbol combinations do not pay separately.</p>
			<p>The Wild symbol acts as an Expanding Wild during Free Games. More information about Free Games can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols <img src="../img/gtsjzc_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> do not have to occur on any particular payline.</p>
			<p>If there are two or more Scatters in any position in the spin results, the payout earned is multiplied by the total bet and added to payline winnings.</p>
			<p>If three or more Scatter symbols appear in any position on the reels simultaneously during main game, the Jazz Solo Bonus round is triggered and the player is given the possibility to win up to 14 Free Games and up to x4 Multiplier. More information about the Jazz Solo Bonus can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Jazz Solo Bonus</strong></p>
			<p>The Jazz Solo Bonus round is triggered only in main game by the appearance of 3 or more Scatters anywhere on the reels on an active payline.</p>
			<p>To start the Jazz Solo Bonus, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>.</p>
			<p>A screen appears saying that the Jazz Solo Bonus follows. Then the themed symbols of the contrabass <img src="../img/gtsjzc_contrabass.jpg" alt="" />, the trumpet <img src="../img/gtsjzc_trumpet.jpg" alt="" />, and the piano <img src="../img/gtsjzc_piano.jpg" alt="" /> soloist are shown. By picking one of the three symbols the player chooses a fixed number and multiplier of the Free Games as follows:</p>
			<table class="table">
			<tbody>
			<tr>
				<th><strong><span style="font-family: verdana;">Themed symbol</span></strong></th>
				<th><strong><span style="font-family: verdana;">Free Games number and multiplier</span></strong></th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>Contrabass soloist</td>
			<td>14 Free Games with a x2 multiplier</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>Trumpet soloist</td>
			<td>10 Free Games with a x1 multiplier</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>Piano soloist</td>
			<td>7 Free Games with a x4 multiplier</td>
			</tr>
			</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>The symbol, which has been chosen by the player, replaces the other two, which have not been picked, during Free Games. The payout of the winning combinations, in which the chosen themed symbol participates, is paid according to the same themed symbol&rsquo;s payout, as seen in the paytable.</p>
			<p><strong>Free Games</strong></p>
			<p>After the Jazz Solo Bonus has ended, the Free Games automatically begin.</p>
			<p>The Wild symbol becomes Expanding Wild during Free Games. Whenever the Wild symbol appears anywhere on reels #2, #3 or #4 and creates a winning combination in any position of either of these reels, it expands to cover the entire reel. All positions on this reel become Wild. All resulting winning combinations are paid.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same number of lines and bets per line as on the spin that won the Free Games. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the spin that won the free games. <strong>Feature win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total win</strong> shows the aggregate winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up).</p>
			<p>If the Free Games are triggered during the Auto Start mode, the feature begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. When all Free Games have been played, the Auto Start mode automatically resumes.</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize. <strong>Free Game</strong> wins are added to the payline and Scatter wins.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 94.91%.</p>
