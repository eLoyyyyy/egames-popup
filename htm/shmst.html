			<p><strong>5-reel 20-line slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Sherlock Mystery is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking + and - below <strong>Line Bet</strong> to increase or decrease the amount.</li>
			<li>Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Lines</strong>. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the currently selected bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spin the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Mouse over the <strong>Auto Play</strong> button to display the list of options. Select the number of spins to be played automatically or choose <strong>Until Feature</strong> to spin until the Crime Scene Bonus or the Free Games round is triggered. Clicking on an option starts the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. The <strong>Auto Play</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Play mode. The Auto Play mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the Crime Scene Bonus or the Free Games round is triggered if you chose <strong>Until Feature</strong>, or when you click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Clicking the <strong>Turbo Mode</strong> button switches on or off the Turbo Mode thus turning on or off some of the win animations and sounds, and making the reels spin faster or slower.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In the case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Crime Scene Bonus</strong> screen describes the symbol combination that triggers the bonus round and explains its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Free Games</strong> screen explains how the feature is triggered and what its rules are.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Paylines</strong> screen illustrates all possible payline combinations and explains the payout rules in the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels as illustrated in the <strong>Paylines</strong> screen of the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the left most reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol <img src="../img/shmst_wild.jpg" alt="" /> can stand for any other symbol, except <img src="../img/shmst_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> and <img src="../img/shmst_bonus.jpg" alt="" />, to make the best possible winning combination, and appears both during main game and Free Games.</p>
			<p>There is also a separate payout for 2 or more <img src="../img/shmst_wild.jpg" alt="" /> on an active payline, as seen in the Paytable. This is paid out instead of the regular symbol win if the win amount from the Wild symbols is larger than the win from the regular symbols (by Wild standing in).</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols <img src="../img/shmst_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> do not have to occur on any particular payline and appear on the reels both during main game and Free Games.</p>
			<p>If 3 or more <img src="../img/shmst_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> appear in any position on these reels during main game, the payout earned is multiplied by the total bet and added to payline winnings, if any. In addition, 10 Free Games with Extra Wilds and a random multiplier are triggered as explained <a href="../img/shmst.html#shmst_FreeGames">here</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>Bonus Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Bonus symbol <img src="../img/shmst_bonus.jpg" alt="" /> appears on reels #1, #3 and #5 both during main game and Free Games. Whenever 3x <img src="../img/shmst_bonus.jpg" alt="" /> appear in any position on these reels simultaneously, the Crime Scene Bonus round is triggered as explained <a href="../img/shmst.html#shmst_CrimeSceneBonus">here</a>.</p>
			<p><strong>Sherlock Meets Watson Feature</strong></p>
			<p>Whenever <img src="../img/shmst_watson.jpg" alt="" /> appears to the immediate right of <img src="../img/shmst_sherlock.jpg" alt="" />, the Sherlock Meets Watson Feature is triggered and a prize is added to your current winnings.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Sherlock Meets Watson Feature is available during both main game and the Free Games round.</p>
			<p><a name="shmst_CrimeSceneBonus"></a><strong>Crime Scene Bonus</strong></p>
			<p><img src="../img/shmst_bonus.jpg" alt="" /> appearing anywhere on reels #1, #3 and #5 simultaneously during main game or Free Games, trigger the Crime Scene Bonus.</p>
			<p>To start the bonus round, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>.</p>
			<p>The screen that follows reveals a room, where a crime has been committed. There are 8 items to pick from, each standing for a bonus cash prize. Objects highlighted when mousing-over can be picked. If an item chosen reveals the <strong>Collect</strong> option, first a cash prize is awarded and then the bonus round ends.</p>
			<p>At the end of the bonus game, a win screen displays your winnings. <strong>Game Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the main game that won the bonus. <strong>Feature Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the bonus. <strong>Total Win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (<strong>Game Win</strong> and <strong>Feature Win</strong> added up). Click <strong>Continue</strong> to return to the main game.</p>
			<p>If the Crime Scene Bonus has been triggered during the Auto Play mode, the Bonus round will begin after you click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. After the Bonus has ended, click <strong>Continue</strong>, and the Auto Play mode will resume. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen will stop the win ticker and display the full prize.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Crime Scene Bonus and the Free Games round cannot be triggered during one and the same main game spin. The Crime Scene Bonus cannot be triggered during the Free Games spin that re-triggers the Free Games round.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the Crime Scene Bonus is triggered during Free Games, the Free Games will interrupt for the Bonus round to be played. After the Crime Scene Bonus ends, the bonus cash prizes will be added to your current winnings and then the Free Games round will resume.</p>
			<p><a name="shmst_FreeGames"></a><strong>Free Games</strong></p>
			<p>Whenever 3 or more <img src="../img/shmst_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> appear during main game, 10 Free Games with <img src="../img/shmst_xtrawild.jpg" alt="" /> as Extra Wild and a random multiplier are awarded.</p>
			<p><img src="../img/shmst_xtrawild.jpg" alt="" /> can stand for all symbols except <img src="../img/shmst_wild.jpg" alt="" />, <img src="../img/shmst_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> and <img src="../img/shmst_bonus.jpg" alt="" /> during the Free Games round. Whenever it participates in a winning combination during Free Games <img src="../img/shmst_xtrawild.jpg" alt="" /> awards a random multiplier of x2, x3, or x5 to the wins from the current spin only, if any. Regardless of the number of <img src="../img/shmst_xtrawild.jpg" alt="" /> along one and the same winning payline, this multiplier is applied just once and only to the wins resulting from the payline <img src="../img/shmst_xtrawild.jpg" alt="" /> has taken part in.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> In order for <img src="../img/shmst_xtrawild.jpg" alt="" /> to substitute for any symbol other than the abovementioned ones, that symbol would have to appear along the same active payline as <img src="../img/shmst_xtrawild.jpg" alt="" />. For example, for a combination of 4x <img src="../img/shmst_xtrawild.jpg" alt="" /> and a regular symbol &ldquo;A&rdquo;, the payout you are going to win will equal the payout for 5x regular symbol &ldquo;A&rdquo;, according to the Paytable, multiplied by the awarded random multiplier. Whenever 5-of-a-kind <img src="../img/shmst_xtrawild.jpg" alt="" /> combination appears along an active payline, the payout that you will receive will be equal to the payout of 5x <img src="../img/shmst_pistol.jpg" alt="" />multiplied by the awarded multiplier.</p>
			<p>3 or more <img src="../img/shmst_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> appearing simultaneously on the reels during Free Games re-trigger the Free Games round.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Free Games round and the Crime Scene Bonus cannot be triggered during one and the same main game spin. The Crime Scene Bonus cannot be triggered during the Free Games spin that re-triggers the Free Games round.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the Crime Scene Bonus is triggered during Free Games, the Free Games will be interrupted in order for the Bonus round to be played. After the Crime Scene Bonus ends, the bonus cash prizes will be added to your current winnings and then the Free Games round will resume.</p>
			<p>To start the Free Games round, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same number of lines and bets per line as on the spin that won the Free Games round. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the spin that won the Free Games. <strong>Feature Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total Win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up).</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p>If the Free Games have been triggered during the Auto Play mode, the Free Games round begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. When all Free Games have been played and the player clicks <strong>Continue</strong> on the screen summarizing the Free Games win, the Auto Play mode resumes. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
