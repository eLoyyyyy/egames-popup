			<p>The object of Pinball Roulette is to predict where the ball will come to rest on the Roulette strip. The Pinball Roulette strip consists of numbers 1 through 36, alternately colored red and black, plus 0, which is green.</p>

			<p>The minimum and maximum bet limits are dependent on your VIP level.</p>

			<p>All the different betting options and corresponding payouts are explained in the section Pinball Roulette Rules.</p>

			<h4>To play the game:</h4>
			<ul>
			<li><p>On the lower left of the game window, click on a chip of the desired value to select it.</p></li>
			<li><p>Place your bet:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><p>Click on a number or a betting area on the board.</p></li>
					<li><p>Place a neighbour bet below the board.</p></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><p>If you wish to increase the bet by a different amount then select another chip and place your bet.</p></li>
			<li><p>To decrease a placed bet, click Undo last bet to remove the most recently placed chip, or Clear all bets to remove all the chips placed on the board.</p></li>
			<li><p>You can place several chips into different betting areas simultaneously. Your total bet is shown in the lower right of the game window, in the field Total bet.</p></li>
			<li><p>The lower edge of the game window contains the following game-related buttons.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><p><strong>Turbo Bet</strong> &ndash; Clicking this button enables the turbo betting mode. In the turbo betting mode, the ball animation is skipped and the result is shown instantly. The turbo mode also applies to the bonus round.</p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Auto Bet</strong> &ndash; Clicking this button enables the autoplay mode. You can choose whether to play 1, 2, 5 or 10 consecutive game rounds with the same bet.</p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Repeat Bet</strong> &ndash; Clicking this button places the same bet as during the previous game round. After clicking Repeat Bet you can also place other bets, if you wish. Note that after clicking Repeat Bet you must click Bet to set the ball in motion.</p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Bet</strong> &ndash; Clicking this button confirms all the placed bets and sets the ball in motion.</p></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><p>All the numbers that you placed a bet on are highlighted on the rotating Roulette strip and marked with a chip on the Roulette board next to the pinball playfield.</p></li>
			<li><p>After a winning game round you have the option to gamble with your winnings by playing the bonus round. If you want to play the bonus game click Gamble. To skip it and return to the main game click Collect.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><p>In the bonus round you can increase the winnings from the main game, but you may also lose them. Once you choose Gamble, the ball is launched into the pinball playfield. If the ball hits one or more multiplier bumpers lighting up the multiplier stars and then falls into the wide slot in the lower middle, you win.</p></li>
					<li><p>During the bonus round you can win up to 10 times your bonus round bet (i.e. the win from the main game round) depending on the number of hit multipliers.</p></li>
					<li><p>If the ball does not light up any multipliers, you lose your bet and the bonus round ends.</p></li>
					<li><p>If the ball lights up the multiplier bumpers but falls into one of the Lose slots, you lose your bet and the bonus round ends.</p></li>
					<li><p>After a winning bonus round you can choose to gamble again by clicking Gamble or collect the winnings by clicking Collect.</p></li>
					<li><p>If the ball rolls through the Bonus ball! chute during the bonus round, the Lose slots are removed for that round. This means that it is not possible to lose existing winnings during this round. So, even if the ball does not hit any multipliers, your winnings are safe!</p></li>
					<li><p>If you choose to gamble again after the Bonus ball! round, the Lose slots reappear and the round is played like regular bonus round.</p></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><p>After a non-winning game round click New Game to play again, or Repeat Bet to play again with the same bet as during the previous game round.</p></li>
			</ul>
