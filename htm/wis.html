			<p><strong>5-Reel 20-line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The object of Wild Spirit is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>A wagering denomination (coin value) can be chosen by clicking the <strong>Click to Change</strong> denomination button in the lower left-hand corner of the screen.</li>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking <strong>Bet per Line</strong>. Each click adds a coin to the line bet. When the maximum amount is reached (10 coins of the selected wagering denomination), clicking the button again resets the line bet to one coin.</li>
			<li>Paylines are chosen by clicking <strong>Lines</strong>. Each click activates a payline. When all paylines are activated, clicking the button again resets it to one active payline. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the maximum bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spins the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Start</strong> function. Clicking + or &ndash; above <strong>Auto Start</strong> selects the successive number of spins to be enabled. Clicking <strong>Auto Start</strong> spins the reels. The <strong>Auto Start</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Start mode of reelspin. The Auto Start mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the player clicks <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are added up together.</li>
			<li>In case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			<li>A win activates the <strong>Gamble</strong> button which, when clicked, opens the gamble page. Winnings can be doubled by choosing a higher card than that automatically chosen by the dealer. After all wins or ties, players can click <strong>Collect</strong> or try to double the new amount.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Bonus</strong> screen describes the necessary combination of symbols to enter the bonus round and describes the bonus round rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Gamble</strong> screen describes how to try doubling winnings by gambling with them and describes the doubling-up rules.</li>
			</ul>
			<li><strong>Show Paylines</strong> can be clicked from the Paytable page to open a screen which illustrates all possible payline combinations. Clicking <strong>Hide Paylines</strong> closes this screen and returns to the Paytable page.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels. Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking <strong>Lines</strong>.</li>
			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>If a symbol has a winning combination on more than one reel, the winnings are added up.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the leftmost reel, and the symbols have to be on consecutive reels.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the left most reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols do not have to occur on a particular payline &ndash; if there are three or more Scatter symbols in the results, an additional win is earned. The payout for Scatter symbols is multiplied by the total bet.</p>
			<p><strong>Bonus symbol</strong></p>
			<p>When Bonus symbols appear on the first and last reels, the bonus round immediately begins and the player is awarded a guaranteed prize of 5 times the total bet.</p>
			<p>The bonus round offers a choice between a selection of symbols on the Great Manitou&rsquo;s canvas:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Some Good symbols award 1 to 5 free spins.</li>
			<li>Other Good symbols increase the win multiplier of the free spins by 2.</li>
			<li>Still other Good symbols are Magic symbols. If a Magic symbol is picked, three winning symbols are picked automatically from the remaining ones.</li>
			<li>And finally, there are some Evil symbols. Picking an Evil symbol ends the bonus round, but awards one free spin.</li>
			<li>In the bonus round Good symbols are picked one by one until an Evil symbol is picked, or until all winning and Magic symbols have been picked.</li>
			</ul>
			<p></p>
			<p>During the free spins, the reels are spun automatically using the same number of lines and bets per line as on the spin that won the free spins. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Spin Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current free spins.</p>
			<p>After all free spins have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the spin that won the free spins. <strong>Feature win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the free spins. <strong>Total win</strong> shows the aggregate winnings (Game Win and Bonus Win added up).</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game. If Bonus symbols appear on the first and last reels during a free spin, 8 new free spins are added to the existing ones. The win multiplier does not change.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 91.97%.</p>
