			<p><strong>5-reel 25-line slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Wolverine is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking + and - below <strong>Line Bet</strong> to increase or decrease the amount.</li>
			<li>Wolverine game is always played with 25 active paylines. The number of active paylines is fixed and cannot be changed by the player.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the currently selected bet. During the reel spin the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking<strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Mouse over the <strong>Auto Play</strong> button to display the list of options. Select the number of spins to be played automatically or choose <strong>Until Feature</strong> to spin until the Berserker Rage Feature or the Adamantium Free Games round is triggered. Clicking on an option starts the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. The <strong>Auto Play</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong>during the Auto Play mode. The Auto Play mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the Berserker Rage Feature or the Adamantium Free Games round is triggered if you chose <strong>Until Feature</strong>, or when you click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Clicking the <strong>Turbo Mode</strong> button switches on or off the Turbo Mode thus turning on or off some of the win animations and sounds, and making the reels spin faster or slower.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In the case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Stacked Wilds</strong> screen explains the specific behaviour of the Stacked Wilds in the game.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Berserker Rage Feature</strong> screen describes how to trigger the feature and explains its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Adamantium Free Games</strong> screen explains how the Adamantium Free Games are triggered and played.</li>
			<li><strong>Marvel Multi-Level Mystery Progressive Jackpot</strong> screen describes how to win entry to the Marvel Multi-Level Mystery Progressive Jackpot game that wins one of four jackpots, and explains the game&rsquo;s rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Paylines</strong> screen illustrates all possible payline combinations and explains the payout rules in the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels as illustrated in the <strong>Paylines</strong> screen of the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>All 25 active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are added up.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the left most reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol <img src="../img/wvm_wild.jpg" alt="" /> can stand for any other symbol, except <img src="../img/wvm_scatter.jpg" alt="" />, <img src="../img/wvm_syringe.jpg" alt="" /> and <img src="../img/wvm_berserker.jpg" alt="" />, to make the best possible winning combination and appears both during main game and Free Games. More information about the Adamantium Free Games can be found <a href="../img/wvm.html#wvmFG">here</a>.</p>
			<p>There is also a separate payout for 2 or more Wild symbols on an active payline, as seen in the Paytable. This is paid out instead of the regular symbol win if the win amount from Wild is larger than the win from the regular symbols (by Wild standing in).</p>
			<p><strong>Stacked Wild</strong></p>
			<p><img src="../img/wvm_wild.jpg" alt="" /> can appear as stacked and non-stacked on all 5 reels. Whenever <img src="../img/wvm_wild.jpg" alt="" /> appears as stacked, it occupies 2 <img src="../img/wvm_wild2.jpg" alt="" /> or 3 <img src="../img/wvm_wild3.jpg" alt="" />positions on the reels. All positions covered by Stacked and non-stacked Wild on these particular reels act as Wild.</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols <img src="../img/wvm_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> do not have to occur on any particular payline. If there are 3 or more Scatter symbols in any position in the spin results, the payout earned is multiplied by the total bet and added to payline winnings.</p>
			<p><strong>Berserker Rage Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Berserker Rage symbol <img src="../img/wvm_berserker.jpg" alt="" /> appears on reel #5 during main game only and triggers the Berserker Rage Feature as explained below.</p>
			<p><strong>Berserker Rage Feature</strong></p>
			<p>The Berserker Rage Feature is triggered whenever <img src="../img/wvm_berserker.jpg" alt="" /> appears on reel #5 in the reel-spin results during main game. To let the feature round begin click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>.</p>
			<p>You are awarded a free spin, during which 2 - 5 Wilds are randomly distributed on the reels. Depending on the position of <img src="../img/wvm_berserker.jpg" alt="" /> on reel #5, there are 3 different ways of <img src="../img/wvm_wild.jpg" alt="" /> being distributed:</p>
			<table class="table">
			<tbody>
			<tr>
			<th><strong><span style="font-family: verdana;">Position on reel #5</span></strong></th>
			<th><strong><span style="font-family: verdana;">Wild distribution</span></strong></th></tr>
			<tr>
			<td>
			<p align="left"><img src="../img/wvm_berserker.jpg" alt="" /> on top position</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p align="left">2, 3, or 4 adjacent and horizontally-positioned symbols from left to right will be randomly covered by <img src="../img/wvm_wild.jpg" alt="" />.</p>
			</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>
			<p align="left"><img src="../img/wvm_berserker.jpg" alt="" /> on middle position</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p align="left">3, 4, or 5 <img src="../img/wvm_wild.jpg" alt="" /> will be randomly distributed anywhere on the reels.</p>
			</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>
			<p align="left"><img src="../img/wvm_berserker.jpg" alt="" /> on bottom position</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p align="left">2 reels will turn into Stacked Wild <img src="../img/wvm_wild3.jpg" alt="" />.</p>
			</td>
			</tr>
			</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>Random Wild, distributed during the Berserker Rage Feature and covering regular Wild (both stacked and non-stacked), pay only once.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Berserker Rage Feature cannot be retriggered during the free spins awarded. No Scatter symbols appear on the reels while the Berserker Rage Feature is active.</p>
			<p><a name="wvmFG"></a><strong>Adamantium Free Games</strong></p>
			<p>Whenever 3 or more <img src="../img/wvm_syringe.jpg" alt="" /> appear anywhere on the reels during main game, 12 Adamantium Free Games are triggered.</p>
			<p>To start the Adamantium Free Games, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. Then click <strong>Continue</strong> for the Free Games round to begin.</p>
			<p>On the following screen a tank with 12 levels appears on the left. It will contain a different amount of Adamantium depending on the number of <img src="../img/wvm_syringe.jpg" alt="" /> that triggered the Free Games round:</p>
			<table class="table">
			<tbody>
			<tr>
			<th><strong><span style="font-family: verdana;">No of triggering symbols</span></strong></th>
			<th><strong><span style="font-family: verdana;">Initial amount of Adamantium</span></strong></th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>3x <img src="../img/wvm_syringe.jpg" alt="" /></td>
			<td>4 levels</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>4x <img src="../img/wvm_syringe.jpg" alt="" /></td>
			<td>8 levels</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>5x <img src="../img/wvm_syringe.jpg" alt="" /></td>
			<td>12 levels</td>
			</tr>
			</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>Whenever <img src="../img/wvm_wild.jpg" alt="" />, <img src="../img/wvm_wild2.jpg" alt="" /> or <img src="../img/wvm_wild3.jpg" alt="" /> appear in the Free Games results, a level of the Adamantium from the tank will be used to &ldquo;inject&rdquo; each symbol and to &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; it for the upcoming spin. <img src="../img/wvm_wild3.jpg" alt="" />, <img src="../img/wvm_wild2.jpg" alt="" /> or <img src="../img/wvm_wild.jpg" alt="" />, injected by syringe, will decrease tank level by -1. <img src="../img/wvm_wild.jpg" alt="" />that were previously frozen can be frozen again if there is still Adamantium left in the tank.</p>
			<p>Whenever <img src="../img/wvm_syringe.jpg" alt="" /> appears in the Free Games results, a level of Adamantium will be added to the tank. Even if <img src="../img/wvm_syringe.jpg" alt="" /> is covered by a &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; Wild, the covered symbol will still count and will increase the amount of Adamantium by 1 level. The tank cannot be filled more than 12 levels. <img src="../img/wvm_syringe.jpg" alt="" /> cannot be stored.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you have run out of Adamantium while the Free Games round is still going on, the Wild that appear in the reel-spin results, if any, will not be &ldquo;frozen&rdquo; and will spin together with the other symbols on the reels. If the Wild, appearing in the Free Games results, are more than the level of Adamantium necessary to &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; all of them, they will be &ldquo;injected&rdquo; one by one starting from left to right, from top to bottom, beginning with <img src="../img/wvm_wild3.jpg" alt="" />, <img src="../img/wvm_wild2.jpg" alt="" /> then <img src="../img/wvm_wild.jpg" alt="" />.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> The Adamantium Free Games cannot be retriggered.</p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same number of lines and bets per line as on the spin that won the Free Games round. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the spin that won the Free Games. <strong>Feature Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total Win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up).</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize. Free Games Win is added to the payline and Scatter wins.</p>
			<p>If the Free Games have been triggered during the Auto Play mode, the Free Games round begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. When all Free Games have been played and the player clicks <strong>Continue</strong> on the screen summarizing the Free Games win, the Auto Play mode resumes. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>

			<p><strong>Marvel Mystery Jackpot</strong></p>
			<p>Marvel Mystery Jackpot is a multi-level progressive jackpot game that is available in all Marvel games and is linked to all Marvel games. A small percentage of each bet in the Marvel games, by every person playing this game in each of many online casinos, is added to the progressive jackpot.</p>
			<p>The trigger that starts the Jackpot game is random and can occur after any spin in any of the linked games. It is not caused by any symbol combination in the linked games and even a spin that does not win anything in the main game can trigger the Jackpot game. Likewise, any bet with any size in the linked games can trigger the Jackpot game. Nonetheless, the chances of triggering the Jackpot game increase or decrease proportionally to the bet size. Entering the Jackpot game guarantees a win of one of the four jackpots. Playing the Jackpot game reveals the jackpot that has been awarded to you, but does not determine it.</p>
			<p>There are four different levels of jackpots that you can win: Power Jackpot, Extra Power Jackpot, Super Power Jackpot and Ultimate Power Jackpot. Different types of jackpots hold different prize amounts. The jackpot gamescreen contains 20 squares which in the beginning of the gameplay are turned upside down. Clicking on a square will turn it around and reveal one of four jackpot symbols on the other side. Once you have found three matching symbols, you win the jackpot that corresponds to these symbols. Jackpot winnings are added to the main game winnings (if any) and are displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field together with any other winnings.</p>
			<p>The Marvel Mystery Jackpot game has a timeout timer. This means that if you do not pick a square in a set amount of time, you will automatically receive your prize.</p>
			<p>The Jackpot for this game works like this:</p>
			<table class="table">
			<tbody>
			<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>Seed</strong> (how much money the Jackpots start out with):</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Power: &euro;50<br />Extra Power: &euro;500<br />Super Power: &euro;5,000<br />Ultimate Power: &euro;100,000</p>
			</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>Contribution rate</strong> (what percentage of each bet goes into Jackpot):</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>0.99%</p>
			</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>Win condition</strong> (the result you have to get to win the Jackpot):</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Entering the jackpot game guarantees a win. Match 3 jackpot symbols of the corresponding Jackpot or wait for the timer to run out.</p>
			</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>Win requirements</strong> (what you need to do to be eligible for the Jackpot):</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>Play a Marvel game.</p>
			</td>
			</tr>
			</tbody>
			</table>
			<p><strong>Please note:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>The seed and Jackpot values are in Euros in the progressive network and their value in your local currency is dependent on the currency exchange rate.</li>
			<li>The mechanics of Marvel Mystery Jackpot prohibit simultaneous jackpot winnings.</li>
			<li>Imperfections in the Internet connectivity may cause you to experience delays in Jackpot messages or updates, but they do not affect actual Jackpot wins.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 91.86%.</p>
