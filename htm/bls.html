			<p>Megaball is eight-games-in-one where each game is a different betting strategy. Every minute six balls are drawn to determine the winning combinations. You can play one betting strategy or up to 10 at a time.</p>

			<p>In the center of the game screen a choice of eight games is available — each game offers a different betting strategy. Click any of them then follow the displayed instructions. Each game offers you the choice to play for one drawing or multiple drawings (up to 50 repetitions).</p>

			<p>A table displays your active bets at the bottom of the screen. After you have submitted all of your bets, you can click on each bet in the table to modify or delete it.</p>

			<p>A clock displaying the time remaining until the start of the next draw is displayed at the top of the screen. During the last 10 seconds of the countdown, you cannot place a bet (the Confirm button will no longer be displayed). Wait until the Confirm button appears then you can place a bet for the next drawing.</p>

			<h4>Jackpot</h4>

			</p>One of the possible wins in this game is the progressive Jackpot, built up by all the casinos that offer the game. A small percentage of each bet, by every person playing this game in each of many online casinos, is added to a common pot. When a player gets the right result, that player wins the entire Jackpot (in some games you can also win part of it).</p>

			<p>After a Jackpot has been won, a new pot is started, with the casinos contributing a base amount of money (called a seed). This ensures that even if you get a Jackpot result in a game right after someone else has won the Jackpot, you will still get a large win.</p>

			<h4>Please note:</h4>
			<ul>
			<li>In some games you have to make a specific bet to be eligible for the Jackpot.</li>
			<li>If you get disconnected in the middle of a game round, your game does not change the value of the Jackpot. The state of the game up to that point is remembered by the casino; the next time you log in you can finish your game round with the same odds and without placing a new bet.</li>
			<li>If a Jackpot is being discontinued (a game is closed and removed from the casino client), you will be notified of it by the casino.</li>
			<li>The Jackpot for this game works like this:</li>
