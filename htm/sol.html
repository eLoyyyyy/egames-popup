			<p><strong>5-Reel 50-line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Streak of Luck is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking + and - below <strong>Line Bet</strong> to increase or decrease the amount. There are 6 fixed denominations to choose from and a separate progressive jackpot (6 in total) for each denomination.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Jackpot</strong> field displays the currently accumulated Jackpot sum depending on your bet.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X 50. This is due to the fact that the game Streak of Luck is played using a fixed number of 50 active lines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the currently selected bet. During the reel spin the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking<strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Mouse over the <strong>Auto Play</strong> button to display the list of options. Select the number of spins to be played automatically or choose <strong>Until Feature</strong> to spin until the Lucky Free Games, the Dice Bonus or the Lucky Jackpot is triggered. Clicking on an option starts the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. The <strong>Auto Play</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Play mode. The Auto Play mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the Lucky Free Games, the Dice Bonus or the Lucky Jackpot is triggered if you chose <strong>Until Feature</strong>, or when you click<strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Clicking the <strong>Turbo Mode</strong> button switches on or off the Turbo Mode thus turning on or off some of the win animations and sounds, and making the reels spin faster or slower.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In the case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			<li>The pole to the right of the reels indicates the number of consecutive wins. More information can be found <a href="../img/sol.html#sol_counter">here</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Dice Bonus</strong> screen explains how this feature is triggered and how to play it.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Lucky Free Games</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to trigger the Free Games feature and describes its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Lucky Jackpot</strong> screen explains how this feature is triggered and its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Paylines</strong> screen illustrates all possible paylines and explains the rules for calculating their wins.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>The <strong>Launch Tutorial</strong> button on the Info page can be clicked to start a brief, step-by-step explanation of the game.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels as illustrated in the <strong>Paylines</strong> screen of the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>All 50 active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are added up.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the left most reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol <img src="../img/sol_wild.jpg" alt="" /> can stand for any other symbol, except for the Scatter and Bonus symbols, to make the best possible winning combination. There is also a separate payout for 2 or more Wild symbols on a payline, as seen in the Paytable. This is paid out instead of the regular symbol win if the win amount from Wild symbols is larger than the win from the regular symbols (by Wild standing in).</p>
			<p>The Wild symbol can appear both stacked - one above the other, and non-stacked on all reels.</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols <img src="../img/sol_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> do not have to occur on any particular payline. If there are 3 or more Scatter symbols in any position in the spin results, the payout is multiplied by the total bet and added to the payline winnings, if any.</p>
			<p><strong>Bonus symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Bonus symbol <img src="../img/sol_bonus.jpg" alt="" /> appears on reels 1, 3 and 5 only and triggers the Dice Bonus when appearing anywhere on these 3 reels simultaneously.</p>
			<p><strong>Dice Bonus</strong></p>
			<p>If a Bonus symbol <img src="../img/sol_bonus.jpg" alt="" /> appears on reels 1, 3 and 5 simultaneously during the main game or Free Games, the <strong>Dice Bonus</strong> is triggered.</p>
			<p>To start the feature, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong> in the lower right-hand corner of the game window.</p>
			<p>You are awarded 3 dice rolls. Roll the dice for cash prizes by clicking <strong>Roll</strong> at the bottom of the game window.</p>
			<p>Each roll awards a cash prize which equals the score on the dice multiplied by the current total bet. When the dice score is a double (e.g. two 3s, two 6s, etc.), an extra roll is awarded, to the maximum of 6 rolls in total.</p>
			<p>There is an extra payout called Lucky 7s. Scoring 7 twice awards 20 times your total bet and scoring 7 three times awards 200 times your total bet. <strong>Note:</strong> In the case of three 7s, only the 200 times award will be paid (and not the 20 times for two 7s).</p>
			<p>The win after each roll will be displayed on the meter to the right of the table.</p>
			<p>At the end of the Bonus round, a win screen displays your winnings. <strong>Game Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the main game or free game spin that won the Bonus. <strong>Bonus Win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Bonus. <strong>Total Win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (Game Win and Bonus Win added up). Click <strong>Continue</strong> to return to the main game reels.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the Dice Bonus is triggered during Free Games, all wins received during the Bonus round are doubled.</p>
			<p><strong><a name="sol_counter"></a>Wins Counter</strong></p>
			<p>When there are consecutive wins (&ldquo;lucky streak&rdquo;), the steps on the meter to the right of the reels light up. When the 4th arrow at the bottom of the ladder lights up, this will guarantee the first Free Games prize.</p>
			<p>The consecutive wins status is saved and later restored for every denomination, whenever the player changes the denomination or exits the game.</p>
			<p>When the player has accumulated at least 4 consecutive wins and the following spin is not a winning one, the respective prize (secured by the last winning spin) is granted.</p>
			<p>Below are the numbers of consecutive wins and their respective prizes:</p>
			<table class="table"><colgroup><col width="150" /><col width="330" /></colgroup>
			<tbody>
			<tr><th><strong><span style="font-family: verdana;">Consecutive wins</span></strong></th><th><strong><span style="font-family: verdana;">Award</span></strong></th></tr>

			<p>Non-winning spins reset the wins counter. In addition, in case of more than 10 consecutive winning spins, the counter is reset but will resume counting until a non-winning spin occurs.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> Only wins received during the main game and the Dice Bonus count as qualifying for the prizes, whereas wins received during the Free Games round do not count.</p>
			<p><strong>Lucky Free Games</strong></p>
			<p>The Lucky Free Games are triggered when the player gets between 4 and 9 consecutive wins and their next spin is a non-winning one.</p>
			<p>To start the feature, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong> in the lower right-hand corner of the game window.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same bet per line as on the spin that won the Free Games. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games. The <strong>Multiplier</strong> field shows the win multiplier value. The number of free spins remaining is shown above the reels.</p>
			<p>Win multipliers are applied to all wins from a given Free Games round.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p><strong>Lucky Jackpot</strong></p>
			<p>The Lucky Jackpot is a progressive jackpot triggered if the player gets 10 consecutive wins.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> Only wins received during the main game and the Dice Bonus count as qualifying for the jackpot, whereas wins received during the Free Games round do not count. There are 6 separate progressive jackpots, one for each of the 6 fixed line bet denominations. The higher the denomination is, the higher the jackpot will be.</p>
			<p>You can change the denomination at any time. If you change the denomination or exit the game while the consecutive wins counter is larger than 0, the game will remember the count (per denomination) and will restore it once you return to said denomination (or return to the game).</p>
			<p>Once the jackpot is won, the win count to the right of the reels is reset.</p>
			<p>The Jackpot for this game works like this:</p>
			<table class="table">
			<tbody>
			<tr>
			<td><strong>Seed</strong> (how much money the Jackpot starts out with):</td>
			<td>Depends on the line bet. The higher the line bet, the higher the seed will be.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td><strong>Contribution rate</strong> (what percentage of each bet goes into the Jackpot):</td>
			<td>1.40%</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td><strong>Win condition</strong> (the result you have to get to win the Jackpot):</td>
			<td>Accumulate 10 consecutive wins (either from main game or from the Dice Bonus).</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td><strong>Win requirements </strong>(what you need to do to be eligible for the Jackpot):</td>
			<td>Play the Streak of Luck slot game.</td>
			</tr>
			</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> In case a player wins the Lucky Jackpot while 1 or more other players are spinning for it, the player who 1st triggered the feature will win the full jackpot amount (seed plus progressive) whereas the other player(s) will only be awarded the jackpot seed.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 94.99%.</p>
