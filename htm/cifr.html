			<strong>8-Line Slots</strong>

			<p>The object of Chinese Kitchen is to obtain a winning symbol combination by spinning the reels.</p>

			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Choose the value of the coins you wish to bet by clicking on the <strong>+</strong> and <strong>&ndash;</strong> buttons on the right of the screen.</li>
				<li>Select the paylines you want to bet on by clicking the line number on the upper and left edge of the reels. Then click on the <strong>Bet One</strong> button to bet a coin on each of the paylines &ndash; click again to add another coin. Click <strong>Bet Max</strong> to bet the maximum of three coins on each line. Remember that your total bet (the amount you spend on the game round) is the line bet multiplied by the number of lines selected. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> also spins the reels automatically.</li>
				<li>Click <strong>Spin</strong> (if you did not use <strong>Bet Max</strong>) to spin the reels.</li>
				<li>If the reels show a winning combination after they stop (along a payline you bet on), you win according to the winning table. Click the <strong>Paytable</strong> button to see the paytable, if you wish. Close the paytable by clicking the <strong>Paytable</strong> button again. If you win on multiple paylines simultaneously, your winnings are added up.</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>

			<p>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels. You can activate paylines and see their shape by progressively clicking the <strong>Bet One </strong>button.</p>

			<p><strong>Please note:</strong> You only win if a combination occurs on an active payline. The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>

			<p><strong>About the winning tables:</strong></p>

			<p>The tables show a certain number for every symbol combination that pays. Multiply your line bet by that number and you get the winning amount. If you have winning combinations on multiple lines, add them all up to get the winning amount. Please note that except for the crab, all one-symbol and two-symbol combinations have to start on the leftmost or upmost reel (depending on the payline) to win.</p>

			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>

			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 96.92%.</p>

			<p><strong>Please note:</strong> There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much you're betting on a single payline. The total bet shows how much you're spending in this game round. The payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet, not by the total bet. If you get winning combinations on more than one payline, the winnings for each payline are added up.</p>
