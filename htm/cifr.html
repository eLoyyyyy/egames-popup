			<p><strong>5-Reel Slots with a Progressive Jackpot</strong></p>
			<p>The object of Cinerama is to obtain a winning symbol combination by spinning the reels. The better your symbol combination, the bigger the payout.</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Select the number of paylines you want to activate (in other words, to bet on) by clicking on the <strong>Bet One</strong> button or the payline number left or right of the reels. When you click on payline number 3 for example, you also activate paylines 1 and 2. Each click on the <strong>Bet One</strong> buttons activates one more payline. Click <strong>Bet Max</strong> or payline number 5 to select all paylines. Remember that your total bet (the amount you spend on the game round) is line bet x number of lines selected. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> will also spin the reels automatically.</li>
			<li>Click <strong>Spin</strong> (if you did not press <strong>Bet Max</strong>) to spin the reels.</li>
			<li>If the reels show a winning combination after they stop (along an activated payline), you win according to the winning table. Click the<strong>Paytable</strong> button to see the paytable, if you wish. Close the paytable by clicking the Paytable button again. If you win on multiple paylines simultaneously, your winnings are added up.</li>
			</ul>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<p>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels. You can activate paylines and see their shape by progressively clicking the<strong>Bet One </strong>button.</p>
			<p><strong>Please note:</strong> You only win if a combination occurs on an active payline. The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p>The Bonus Round 1 symbol is an exception to that rule. Read more about Bonus Round symbols below.</p>
			<p><strong>About the Paytable:</strong></p>
			<p>The tables show a win multiplier for every hit amount for every symbol. For example, if you have four Spotlight symbols in a row on an activated payline, starting on the leftmost reel, you have four hits. Read the number on the line &ldquo;4x&rdquo; next to that symbol. Multiply that symbol by your line bet to get your win amount. If you have winning combinations on more than one line, add them all up to get the total win amount. The symbols have to lie consecutively, starting from the leftmost reel, to qualify as hits.</p>
			<p><strong>Please note:</strong> There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much you're betting on a single payline. The total bet shows how much you're spending in this game round. The payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet, not by the total bet. If you get winning combinations on more than one payline, the winnings for each payline are added up.</p>
			<p><strong>Bonus Rounds:</strong></p>
			<p>The Director and Headphone symbols are bonus symbols. These symbols do not grant you any winnings, but they enable you to enter the Bonus Round. There is two bonus rounds in Cinerama. For Bonus Round 1, you need to get the Headphone symbol anywhere on the first reel. It does not matter if it is on an activated payline or not.</p>
			<p>For Bonus Round 2, you need to get three consecutive Director symbols on an activated payline, starting from the leftmost reel.</p>
			<p>When you enter a bonus round, follow the instructions on the screen. You will be paid a prize according to the choice(s) you make.</p>
			<p><strong>Progressive Jackpot, Scatter and Wild symbols</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Jackpot</strong></p>
			<p>One of the possible wins in this game is the progressive Jackpot, built up by all the casinos that offer the game. A small percentage of each bet, by every person playing this game in each of many online casinos, is added to a common pot. When a player gets the right result, that player wins the entire Jackpot (in some games you can also win part of it).</p>
			<p>After a Jackpot has been won, a new pot is started, with the casinos contributing a base amount of money (called a seed). This ensures that even if you get a Jackpot result in a game right after someone else has won the Jackpot, you will still get a large win.</p>
			<p><strong>Please note:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>In some games you have to make a specific bet to be eligible for the Jackpot.</li>
			<li>If you get disconnected in the middle of a game round, your game does not change the value of the Jackpot. The state of the game up to that point is remembered by the casino; the next time you log in you can finish your game round with the same odds and without placing a new bet.</li>
			<li>If a Jackpot is being discontinued (a game is closed and removed from the casino client), you will be notified of it by the casino.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Jackpot for this game works like this:</p>
			<table class="table">
			<tbody>
			<tr>
			<td >
			<p><strong>Seed (how much money the Jackpot starts out with):</strong></p>
			</td>
			<td >
			<p>300&nbsp;000 x coin size</p>
			</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td >
			<p><strong>Contribution rate (what percentage of each bet goes into the Jackpot):</strong></p>
			</td>
			<td >
			<p>1%</p>
			</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td >
			<p><strong>Win condition (the result you have to get to win the Jackpot):</strong></p>
			</td>
			<td >
			<p>Five wild symbols on an active payline.</p>
			</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			<td >
			<p><strong>Win requirements (what you need to do to be eligible for the Jackpot):</strong></p>
			</td>
			<td >
			<p>Play for max bet.</p>
			</td>
			</tr>
			</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>The Camera symbol is also a wild symbol &ndash; meaning it stands for any other symbol, except the Director and Headphone symbols, and forms winning combinations in a way most profitable for the player.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 96.94%.</p>
