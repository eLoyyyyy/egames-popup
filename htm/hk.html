			<p><strong>5-Reel Multiline Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The object of Highway Kings is to obtain a winning symbol combination by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Choose the amount you wish to bet on each payline, by clicking on the <strong>+</strong> and <strong>&ndash;</strong> buttons on the right of the screen.</li>
			<li>Select the number of paylines you want to bet on by clicking on the <strong>Bet One</strong> button or the line numbers to the left or right of the reels. When you click on line number 5 for example, you also select lines 1-4. Each click on the <strong>Bet One</strong> buttons selects one more line. Click <strong>Bet Max</strong> or line number 9 to select all paylines. Remember that your total bet (the amount you spend on the game round) is line bet multiplied by the number of lines selected. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> will also spin the reels automatically.</li>
			<li>Click <strong>Spin</strong> (if you did not press <strong>Bet Max</strong>) to spin the reels.</li>
			<li>If the reels show a winning combination after they stop (along a payline you bet on), you win according to the winning table. Click the <strong>Paytable</strong> button to see the paytable, if you wish. Close the paytable by clicking the <strong>Paytable</strong> button again. If you win on multiple paylines simultaneously, your winnings are added up.</li>
			</ul>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<p>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels. You can activate paylines and see their shape by progressively clicking the <strong>Bet One </strong>button.</p>
			<p><strong>Please note:</strong> You only win if a combination occurs on an active payline. The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About the winning tables:</strong></p>
			<p>The tables show a certain number for every hit amount for every symbol. For example, if you have four symbols in a row starting on the leftmost or rightmost reel (that is four hits), read the number on the line &ldquo;XXXX&rdquo; and in the column under that symbol. Multiply your line bet by that number and you get the winning amount. If you have winning combinations on multiple lines, add them all up to get the winning amount. The symbols have to lie consecutively, starting from the leftmost or rightmost reel, to qualify as hits. In case one payline contains two winning combinations (for example: two yellow trucks counted from the left and three tires counted from the right), you are paid for both combinations. If you have five symbols in a row, you are only paid once.</p>
			<p><strong>Please note:</strong> There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much you're betting on a single payline. The total bet shows how much you're spending in this game round. The payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet, not by the total bet. If you get winning combinations on more than one payline, the winnings for each payline are added up.</p>
			<p>The red truck symbol with &ldquo;Wild&rdquo; written on it is a wild symbol &ndash; meaning it stands for any other symbol, like a joker in card games. Also, the wild symbol doubles any win in the combination it is in, but not cumulatively (that is, two wild symbols still multiply the win by 2 and not by 4). The red truck symbol appears on reels 2, 3 and 4 only.</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter symbol:</strong></p>
			<p>The exhaust pipe with &ldquo;Scatter&rdquo; written on it is a scatter symbol &ndash; when you get 2 to 5 of these symbols on the screen, you are paid according to the table shown on the winnings table (scatter win is calculated by multiplying the number on the respective row of the scatter paytable with your TOTAL bet, not just the line bet). The symbols have to lie consecutively, starting from the leftmost or rightmost reel. They don&rsquo;t have to follow any payline. Scatter wins are added to payline wins (if you don&rsquo;t have any payline wins, you are only paid the scatter win).</p>
			<p> <strong>Dollar Ball</strong></p>
			<p>This is a lotto-type progressive sidegame where you pick 5 numbers out of 49. Then once you start the main game, five numbers will be drawn randomly. The more numbers match your selection, the more you win. If all five numbers match, you win the Jackpot.</p>
			<p>Dollar Ball resides in the top right part of the screen. Click <strong>Enable</strong> to play it. You will see a set of numbers, from 1 to 49. Click on any five of them to select manually (click again to deselect), or click on <strong>Random pick</strong> to have it done for you automatically. If you want to change the selected numbers, click on any of the already selected numbers to uncheck them, and then click the new ones. Click<strong>Activate</strong> to hide the numbers and confirm your selection. While the Dollar Ball is activated, an additional Jackpot bet is automatically made each time you make a bet in the main game. The value of the Jackpot bet is fixed and you can find it in the Dollar Ball interface. If you want to cancel the Dollar Ball game, click <strong>Disable</strong>.</p>
			<p>Dollar Ball will be played along with every main game round, with the same numbers, until you either change the numbers or disable the sidegame.</p>
			<p>Your numbers will be shown in a row of white circles at the top of the screen. Once you start a round of the main game, the drawn numbers will appear just above them. If any of the numbers match your selection, the circles containing these numbers will change color to green and your win amount will appear below. It will be added to your balance along with any winnings from the main game round. Dollar Ball wins are paid according to the paytable for Dollar Ball which can be found in the main game paytable. Wins received from 1, 2, or 3 correct numbers are fixed wins and their winning amounts calculated by multiplying the Jackpot bet by the corresponding multiplier.</p>
			<p>In addition to the fixed wins, the Dollar Ball includes progressive wins. A small percentage of each Jackpot bet is added to the common pot by every person playing this game. When a player gets the right result (the five numbers selected match the five numbers drawn), that player wins the entire Jackpot. It is also possible to win part of the Jackpot (1% of the Jackpot) if four out of the five numbers selected match four of the numbers drawn.</p>
			<p>After a Jackpot has been won, a new pot is started, with the casino contributing a base amount of money (called a seed). This ensures that even if you get a Jackpot result in a game right after someone else has won the Jackpot, you will still get a large win.</p>
			<p>Please note:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>You have to make a Jackpot bet to be eligible for the Jackpot.</li>
			<li>You do not have to win the main game round to win the Jackpot.</li>
			<li>The Jackpot contribution applies only when you play with the Dollar Ball enabled.</li>
			<li>All paytable wins and multipliers for the Dollar Ball game correspond to the Jackpot bet only.</li>
			<li>If a Jackpot is being discontinued (a game is closed and removed from the casino client), you will be notified of it by the casino.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
