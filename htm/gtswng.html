			<p><strong>5-Reel 20-line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Wings Of Gold is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking <strong>Bet per Line</strong>. When the maximum amount is reached, clicking the button again resets the line bet.</li>
			<li>Paylines are chosen by clicking <strong>Lines</strong>. Each click activates a payline. When all paylines are activated, clicking the button again resets it to one active payline. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the currently selected bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spins the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Start</strong> function. Clicking + or &ndash; above <strong>Auto Start</strong> selects the successive number of spins to be enabled. Clicking <strong>Auto Start</strong> spins the reels. The <strong>Auto Start</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Start mode of reelspin. The Auto Start mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the player clicks <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are added up together.</li>
			<li>In case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the winnings.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Medal Of Honour Bonus</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to enter the Bonus game and describes its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Xtra Win</strong> screen describes how the Xtra Win mode is activated and explains its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Paylines</strong> screen illustrates all possible paylines and explains the rules for calculating their wins.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels. Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking <strong>Lines</strong>.</li>
			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>If a symbol has a winning combination on more than one reel, the winnings are added up.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the leftmost reel, and the symbols have to be on consecutive reels.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Maximum Win Limit</strong></p>
			<p>The maximum win in the game has an upper limit. For more information, see the Terms and Conditions section.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol <img src="../img/gtswng_wild.jpg" alt="" /> appears only on reels 2, 3 and 4. It can stand for any other symbol, except Scatter, to make the best possible winning combination.</p>
			<p>The Wild symbol becomes Expanding Wild during Free Games. This means that if a Wild symbol appears on a reel after a spin and it is possible to have a winning combination by having a Wild symbol anywhere on that reel, it will expand to cover the entire reel. All places on the reel will be temporarily considered as Wild. All winning combinations that result from this will be paid.</p>
			<p>When the Xtra Win mode is activated Wild becomes Expanding Wild in the main game as well (see below).</p>
			<p><strong>Xtra Win Mode</strong></p>
			<p>The Xtra Win mode can be activated at any time during main game and can be played when the player bets on maximum paylines only. If the game is not played with all 20 active paylines, but the player has activated the Xtra Win mode, a pop-up message appears explaining that the maximum number of lines has also been activated now.</p>
			<p>Activating the Xtra Win mode invests an additional 50% of the player&rsquo;s total bet in each spin. In return, Wild becomes Expanding Wild in the main game. In Xtra Win mode, the Scatter wins are per the new total bet. Line bet wins are still per line bet.</p>
			<p>Xtra Win improves the game&rsquo;s overall payout.</p>
			<p>To trigger the Xtra Win feature, click the <strong>XtraWin</strong> <img src="../img/gtswng_xtrawin.jpg" alt="" /> button. The button then changes into <strong>Active</strong>, and by clicking on it once again the player disables the Xtra Win mode.</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols <img src="../img/gtswng_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> do not have to occur on any particular payline. If there are three or more Scatters in the spin results, the Medal Of Honour Bonus is triggered and the corresponding payout win, detailed in the paytable, is earned. Scatter payout is multiplied by the total bet and added to payline winnings.</p>
			<p><strong>Medal Of Honour Bonus</strong></p>
			<p>The Medal of Honour Bonus is triggered by the appearance of three or more Scatters in the spin result during main game or during Free Games.</p>
			<p>To enter the Medal of Honour Bonus, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>.</p>
			<p>On the screen that appears next, choose one of the three possible symbols. Once you have made your choice, the screen will then be replaced by special reels. The chosen symbol will then appear a random number of times on the special reels.</p>
			<p>The number of symbols appearing determines the number of Free Games won:</p>
			<table class="table">
			<tbody>
			<tr>
			<th><strong><span style="font-family: verdana;">Number of Special Symbols</span></strong></th>
			<th><strong><span style="font-family: verdana;">Free Games Won</span></strong></th></tr>
			<tr>

			<td>100</td>

			<p><strong>Free Games</strong></p>
			<p>After the Medal of Honour Bonus round ends a message detailing the number of free games appears. In a short while, the Free Games start automatically.</p>
			<p>The Wild symbol becomes Expanding Wild during Free Games, regardless of whether the Xtra Win feature is active. The Wild symbol doubles the Free Games win when participating in the combinations, which pay.</p>
			<p>If three or more Scatters appear anywhere on the reels during Free Games, the Medal of Honour Bonus is retriggered. The bonus special reels reappear, and the process is repeated with the same special symbol you have chosen earlier. The number of Free Games is awarded according to the Bonus table. Free Games continue automatically.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same number of lines and bets per line as on the spin that won the Free Games. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the spin that won the free games. <strong>Feature win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total win</strong> shows the aggregate winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up).</p>
			<p>Main Game is automatically resumed.</p>
			<p>If the Free Games are triggered during the Auto Start mode, the feature begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. When all Free Games have been played, the Auto Start mode automatically resumes.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 94.00% in regular mode and 95.00% when playing in Xtra Win mode.</p>
