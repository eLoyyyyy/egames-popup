			<p><strong>5-Reel 20-line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Goddess of Life is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Line Bet</strong> to increase or decrease the amount.</li>
			<li>Paylines are chosen by clicking <strong>Lines</strong>. Each click activates a payline. When all paylines are activated, clicking the button again resets it to one active payline. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the currently selected bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spins the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Start</strong> function. Clicking + or &ndash; above <strong>Auto Start</strong> selects the successive number of spins to be enabled. Clicking <strong>Auto Start</strong> spins the reels. The <strong>Auto Start</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Start mode. The Auto Start mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the player clicks<strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In the case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Crystal Cave Bonus</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to enter the Crystal Cave Bonus and describes its rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Temple of Life Free Games Feature</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to enter the Temple of Life Free Games feature and describes its rules.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Show Paylines</strong> on the <strong>Paytable</strong> page, opens a screen that illustrates all possible payline combinations. Clicking <strong>Hide Paylines</strong> closes this screen and returns to the <strong>Paytable</strong> page.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels. Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking <strong>Lines</strong>.</li>
			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the left most reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Maximum Win Limit</strong></p>
			<p>The maximum win in the game has an upper limit. For more information, see the Terms and Conditions section.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol <img src="../img/gts46_wild.jpg" alt="" /> can stand for any other symbol, except Scatter and Bonus, to make the best possible winning combination. There is also a separate payout for two or more Wild symbols on an active payline, as seen in the Paytable. This is paid out instead of the regular symbol win if the win amount from Wilds is larger than the win from the regular symbols (by Wild standing in).</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols <img src="../img/gts46_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> do not have to occur on any particular payline. If there are two or more Scatters in any position in the spin results, the payout earned is multiplied by the total bet and added to payline winnings.</p>
			<p>If three or more Scatter symbols appear in any position on the reels simultaneously during main game, the Temple of Life Free Games feature is triggered. If three or more Scatter symbols appear in any position on the reels simultaneously during the Free Games, more Free Games are won, as explained below.</p>
			<p><strong>Bonus symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Bonus symbols <img src="../img/gts46_bonus.jpg" alt="" /> can appear only on reels 2, 3 or 4. If three Bonus symbols appear on all three reels in any position simultaneously during the main game or during the Free Games feature, the Crystal Cave Bonus feature is activated.</p>
			<p><strong>Crystal Cave Bonus</strong></p>
			<p>To start the Crystal Cave Bonus, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>.</p>
			<p>The player is presented a screen with 15 crystals to choose from. Click on a crystal to make a selection. Every selection wins a cash prize, which is a multiple of the total bet of the spin that triggered the feature (X1, X2, X3, X4, X5 or X6) until Collect is chosen, which also wins a cash prize and terminates the Bonus. At the end of the Crystal Cave Bonus game, a win screen displays your winnings.<strong>Game win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the main game or free game spin that won the Bonus. <strong>Feature win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Bonus. <strong>Total Win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up). If no winnings were received during the spin that won the Bonus, then only the <strong>Total Win</strong> field will be shown. <br />Click <strong>Continue</strong> to return to the slot reels.</p>
			<p>If the Crystal Cave Bonus is triggered during the Auto Start mode, the feature begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. When the Crystal Cave Bonus is over and the player clicks <strong>Continue</strong> on the screen summarizing the Bonus win, the Auto Start mode resumes. When returning to the reels, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p><strong>Temple of Life Free Games feature</strong></p>
			<p>3 or more Scatter symbols in any position on the reels simultaneously during main game trigger the Temple of Life Free Games feature.</p>
			<p>To start the Temple of Life Free Games feature, click on <strong>Click to Start.</strong></p>
			<p>On the screen that appears next, the player chooses 1 out of 4 life elements to reveal the number of Free Games (7, 10, 15 or 20) you will play. After you have made your choice, a screen appears showing the number of Free Games you have won and explaining Wild&rsquo;s behavior during free games. Click on <strong>Continue</strong> to enter the Free Games round.</p>
			<p>When Wild substitutes during Free Games, the win of that line is multiplied by 3.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same number of lines and bets per line as on the spin that won the Free Games. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the main game spin that won the Free Games. <strong>Feature win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up).</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p>If 3 or more Scatter symbols appear in any position simultaneously on the reels during Free Games, you win additional number of Free Games, chosen randomly (7, 10, 15 or 20).</p>
			<p>Free Game wins are added to the payline and Scatter wins.</p>
			<p>If the Temple of Life Free Games feature is triggered during the Auto Start mode, the feature begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. After the player makes a selection, clicks on <strong>Continue</strong> and all Free Games have been played, a screen appears summarizing the Free Games win. The player clicks on <strong>Continue</strong> and the Auto Start mode resumes. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 95.57%.</p>
