			<p><strong>5-reel 20-line slots</strong></p>
			<p>The object of Dragon Kingdom is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Line Bet</strong> to increase or decrease the amount.</li>
			<li>Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Lines</strong>. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the currently selected bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spins the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Mouse over the <strong>Auto Play</strong> button to display the list of options. Select the number of spins to be played automatically or choose &lsquo;Until Feature&rsquo; to spin until the Free Games round is triggered. Clicking on an option starts the Auto Play function. The <strong>Auto Play</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Play mode. The Auto Play mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when a Free Games round is triggered if you chose &lsquo;Until Feature&rsquo;, or when you click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In the case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			</ul>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Dragon Split Feature</strong> screen describes how this feature is triggered and explains its behaviour.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Free Games</strong> screen describes the symbol combinations necessary to trigger the Free Games feature and describes the Free Games feature rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Paylines</strong> screen illustrates all possible paylines and explains the rules for calculating their wins.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels. Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking + or &ndash; below <strong>Lines</strong>.</li>
			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the left most reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Maximum Win Limit</strong></p>
			<p>The maximum win in the game has an upper limit. For more information, see the Terms and Conditions section.</p>
			<p><strong>Wild symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Wild symbol in the game is the <img src="../img/gtsdgk_wild.jpg" alt="" /> symbol. It can stand for any other symbol, except for Scatter and Split, to make the best possible winning combination. There is also a separate payout for 2 or more Wild symbols on an active payline, as seen in the Paytable. This is paid out instead of the regular symbol win if the win amount from Wilds is larger than the win from the regular symbols (by Wild standing in).</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols <img src="../img/gtsdgk_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> do not have to occur on any particular payline. If there are 3 or more Scatters in any position in the spin results, the payout is multiplied by the total bet and added to the payline winnings, if any.</p>
			<p>If 3 or more Scatter symbols appear simultaneously anywhere on the reels during the main game or during Free Games, 15 Free Games with a dynamic multiplier are triggered. More information on the Free Games round can be found below.</p>
			<p>During Free Games, the Scatter symbol also serves as an Extra Wild and can stand for any other symbol, except for Wild and Split, to make the best possible winning combination.</p>
			<p><strong>Split symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Split symbol <img src="../img/gtsdgk_split.jpg" alt="" /> appears only on the 5th reel. If there is a Split symbol in the reel-spin results, the last symbol in any winning combination will be split into two and will count as two identical symbols. This makes combinations of 6 of a kind possible.</p>
			<p>During the main game all symbols except Scatter can be split.</p>
			<p>During the Free Games round, the Scatter symbol can only be split when serving as an Extra Wild.</p>
			<p><strong>Free Games</strong></p>
			<p>3 or more Scatters appearing simultaneously in any position on the reels during the main game trigger 15 Free Games with a dynamic multiplier. Clicking on <strong>Click to Start</strong> at the lower right-hand corner of the game window starts the feature. Next, a message appears saying that 15 Free Games with an initial multiplier have been won.</p>
			<p>The Free Games round starts with a random initial multiplier of X2, X3, X4 or X5. After each winning spin, the multiplier increases by one step, up to X5. After a non-winning spin, the multiplier decreases by one step, down to X2. Each win is multiplied by the respective multiplier.</p>
			<p>Free Games can be re-triggered infinitely by 3 or more Scatters appearing anywhere on the reels during the Free Games round.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same number of lines and bets per line as on the spin that won the Free Games. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the spin that triggered the Free Games. <strong>Feature win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total win</strong>shows the aggregate winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up).</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 94.02%.</p>
