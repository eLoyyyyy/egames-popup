			<p><strong>5-Reel 25-line Slots</strong></p>
			<p>The objective of Samba Brazil is to obtain winning symbol combinations by spinning the reels.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Line bets are chosen by clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Line Bet</strong> to increase or decrease the amount.</li>
			<li>Paylines can be activated and their shape displayed by progressively clicking + and &ndash; below <strong>Lines</strong>. Paylines can also be activated by using the numbered buttons on either side of the reels. Selecting a high payline includes all the lower ones too. For example, selecting payline 6 also activates paylines 1 through 5. Clicking <strong>Bet Max</strong> activates all paylines with the currently selected bet per line and spins the reels.</li>
			<li>Total bet per game round = line bet X active paylines.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Spin</strong> spins the reels with the current selection of lines and line bets. During the reel spins the <strong>Spin</strong> button changes into<strong>Stop</strong>. Clicking <strong>Stop</strong> ends the spin animation and immediately displays the spin result.</li>
			<li>Reels can also be spun using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Mouse over the <strong>Auto Play</strong> button to display the list of options. Select the number of spins to be played automatically or choose &lsquo;Until Feature&rsquo; to spin until the Samba Music Bonus round is triggered. Clicking on an option starts the Auto Play function. The <strong>Auto Play</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Play mode. The Auto Play mode ends when the reels have been spun the number of times determined by the player, or when the Samba Music Bonus round is triggered if you chose &lsquo;Until Feature&rsquo;, or when you click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>Wins are calculated according to the paytable. Line win = line bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. Scatter win = total bet X corresponding multiplier according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>On a given payline, only the highest payline winning combination pays while simultaneous winnings on different paylines are accumulated.</li>
			<li>In the case of a winning spin, the <strong>Win</strong> field displays the accumulating winnings. The Win ticker can be stopped by clicking anywhere on the screen to display the total win amount immediately.</li>
			<li>Payline wins and the total win are also displayed on the strip located at the bottom of the reels or the game window.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Info</strong> opens the reference screen describing different game components. Clicking the arrow buttons at the lower right-hand corner of the screen enables navigating between the different info screens.</li>
			<ul>
			<li>The <strong>Paytable</strong> screen shows all winning combinations. When opened after a winning spin, the winning symbol combinations (number of symbols and bet multiplier) are highlighted and blink.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Samba Music Bonus</strong> screen specifies the symbol combinations necessary to enter the Samba Music Bonus and describes the bonus round rules.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Expanding Wild Feature</strong> screen explains the rules when <img src="../img/gtssmbr_head.jpg" alt="" /> and <img src="../img/gtssmbr_body.jpg" alt="" /> act as Expanding Wilds.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Mixed Pay Feature</strong> screen describes the specific payout behavior when combinations between <img src="../img/gtssmbr_head.jpg" alt="" /> and <img src="../img/gtssmbr_body.jpg" alt="" />occur.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Paylines</strong> screen illustrates all possible payline combinations and explains the payout rules during main game.</li>
			</ul>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Paylines:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Active paylines are represented by lines that appear over the reels as illustrated in the <strong>Paylines</strong> screen of the <strong>Info</strong> page.</li>
			<li>Only active paylines can register wins.</li>
			<li>There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much is being bet on a single payline. The total bet shows how much is being bet in total on the game round. Payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the line bet.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p><strong>About payouts:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Payouts are listed on the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen. To find the possible win amount, the line bet must be multiplied by the payout.</li>
			<li>If two payline winning combinations occur on the same line, the higher of them is paid out. If more than one active payline has a winning combination, the winnings are accumulated.</li>
			<li>Winning combinations must start from the left most reel, and the symbols have to be consecutive.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The Scatter symbol is an exception to these rules. More information about the Scatter symbol can be found below.</p>
			<p></p>
			<p><strong>Maximum Win Limit</strong></p>
			<p>The maximum win in the game has an upper limit. For more information, see the Terms and Conditions section.</p>
			<p><strong>Mixed Pay Feature</strong></p>
			<p>There are 2 symbols in the game that have specific payout behavior. Both <img src="../img/gtssmbr_head.jpg" alt="" /> and <img src="../img/gtssmbr_body.jpg" alt="" /> function as all other symbols do, with their winning combinations detailed in the Paytable. However, there is a separate payout for any mixed combination of the 2 symbols on an active payline. A mixed combination is a combination that includes both symbols in no particular order, but beginning from the leftmost reel and continuing consecutively along an active payline. This payout is also detailed in the Paytable.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> the Mixed Pay feature is available both during main game and Free Games.</p>
			<p><strong>Stacked Symbols</strong></p>
			<p>The symbols of <img src="../img/gtssmbr_head.jpg" alt="" /> and <img src="../img/gtssmbr_body.jpg" alt="" /> appear on all 5 reels. However, on reels #2, #3 and #4 they can appear as both stacked and not stacked. When 3 identical symbols occupy all 3 positions on a single reel, the reel becomes Expanding Wild if it forms a winning combination. All positions of that particular reel can stand for any symbol, except <img src="../img/gtssmbr_scatter.jpg" alt="" />.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> the stacked symbols act as Expanding Wilds during both main and Free Games.</p>
			<p><strong>Scatter Symbol</strong></p>
			<p>The Scatter symbols <img src="../img/gtssmbr_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> do not have to occur on any particular payline. If there are 2 or more Scatters in any position in the spin results, the payout earned is multiplied by the total bet and added to the payline winnings.</p>
			<p>If 3 or more Scatter symbols appear in any position on the reels simultaneously during main game, the Samba Music Bonus is triggered. More information about the Samba Music Bonus can be found <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
			<p><a name="sambamusic_bonus_section"></a><strong>Samba Music Bonus</strong></p>
			<p>The Samba Music Bonus is triggered by the appearance of 3 or more <img src="../img/gtssmbr_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> on the reels regardless of their position. The bonus round leads to Free Games. More information about Free Games can be found <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
			<p>To start the Samba Music Bonus, click on <strong>Click to Start</strong>.</p>
			<p>A screen with 12 maracas appears. Each of them stands for:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>A cash bonus prize ranging from 1 to 5 times the total bet</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
			<li>A number of Free Games ranging from 5 to 8 (per each item, but you can choose more than one item and win the sum)</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
			<li>A Free Games multiplier ranging from 2 to 3.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Pick maracas by clicking on them one at a time. Once both the multiplier and the number of Free Games have been picked, the Samba Music Bonus ends. The bonus cash prizes that have been won are added up and a screen, summarizing the bonus wins, appears. After you click <strong>Continue</strong>, the bonus cash prizes are added to your balance and the Free Games round automatically begins.</p>
			<p><a name="freegames_section"></a><strong>Free Games</strong></p>
			<p>If 3 or more <img src="../img/gtssmbr_scatter.jpg" alt="" /> appear in any position on the reels simultaneously during Free Games, 10 more Free Games are triggered.</p>
			<p>The stacked symbols are available during Free Games.</p>
			<p>The Mixed Pay feature is available during Free Games as well.</p>
			<p> </p>
			<p>During the Free Games, the reels are spun automatically using the same number of lines and bets per line as on the spin that won the Free Games. After each spin, the win is displayed in the <strong>Win</strong> field. The <strong>Free Games Win</strong> field shows the accumulated winnings from the current Free Games.</p>
			<p>After all Free Games have been completed, a result board summarizes the winnings. <strong>Game win</strong> shows the winnings that were received from the spin that won the free games. <strong>Feature win</strong> shows the winnings that were received during the Free Games. <strong>Total win</strong> shows the accumulated winnings (Game Win and Feature Win added up).</p>
			<p>If Free Games are triggered during the Auto Play mode, the feature begins after the player clicks on <strong>Click to Start</strong>. When all Free Games have been played and the player clicks <strong>Continue</strong> on the screen summarizing the Free Games win, the Auto Play mode resumes. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize.</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong>Continue</strong> will return you to the main game. When returning to the main game, clicking anywhere on the screen stops the win ticker and displays the full prize. <strong>Free Game</strong> wins are added to the payline wins.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 95.08%.</p>
