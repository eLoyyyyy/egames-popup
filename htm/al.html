			<h4>3-Reel Slots with a Bonus Game</h4>

			<p>The object of Alchemist's Lab games is to obtain a winning symbol combination by spinning the reels.</p>

			<h4>To play the game:</h4>
			
			<ul>
				<li><p>Click Bet One, Bet Two or Bet Max (=three) to select the number of coins you wish to wager. Coin value is displayed in the upper right corner of the screen. The reels start to spin.</p></li>
				<li><p>If the reels show a winning combination after they stop (along the payline), you win according to the winning table (see the top panel of the machine).</p></li>
			</ul>


			<h4>Bonus Game:</h4>

			<p>Bonus Slot Machines contain a bonus game. To access the bonus game, you must obtain three book symbols. In the bonus game, click three bottles on the screen. You will then win an amount depending on your selection of bottles.</p>

			<h4>Buttons:</h4>

			<table class="table">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>Bet One</td>
						<td>Bet one coin and spin the reels.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Bet Two</td>
						<td>Bet two coins and spin the reels.</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Bet Max</td>
						<td>Bet all three coins and spin the reels.</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<p>Please note: There is a difference between the line bet and the total bet. The line bet shows how much you're betting on a single payline. The total bet shows how much you're spending in this game round. The payouts shown in the paytable are multiplied by the coin size, not the line bet. If you get winning combinations on more than one payline, the winnings for each payline are added up.</p>

			<h4>Return to Player</h4>

			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 97.32%.</p>
