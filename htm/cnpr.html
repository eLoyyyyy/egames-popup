			<p>The objective of Sweet Party is to obtain matching combinations of 5 or more vertically and/or horizontally adjacent symbols of the same kind to win a multiplier for your bet.</p>
			<p><strong>To play the game:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>The bet per a game round is chosen by clicking the <strong>Bet</strong> arrow buttons to increase or decrease the amount.</li>
			<li>You can also play using the <strong>Auto Play</strong> function. Use the <strong>Auto Play</strong> arrow buttons to select the number of rounds to be played consecutively. The <strong>Play</strong> button changes into <strong>Stop</strong> during the Auto Play mode. The Auto Play mode terminates when the number of game rounds determined by the player has ended, or when you click <strong>Stop</strong>.</li>
			<li>To start the game round, click on <strong>Play</strong>.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Win</strong> field displays the cash prize awarded in case of a winning combination. Wins are calculated according to the paytable. The paytable can be accessed via the Info page.</li>
			<li>The <strong>Jackpot</strong> field displays the currently accumulated Jackpot sum according to the player&rsquo;s bet as explained <a href="../img/cnpr.html#cnpr_jackpot">here</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> The current bet amount is deducted by your balance upon entering the game.</p>
			<p><strong>Info page:</strong></p>
			<ul>
			<li>Click <strong>Info</strong> to open the <strong>Paytable</strong> screen listing all winning combinations and their respective payouts.</li>
			<li>Click on the <strong>Rules</strong> button to see how the game is played. Clicking <strong>OK</strong> will direct you back to the <strong>Paytable</strong> page.</li>
			<li>Clicking <strong>Back</strong> exits the <strong>Info</strong> screen and returns you to the game.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Symbols</strong></p>
			<p>The Sweet Party game features 6 symbols as follows: <img src="../img/cnpr_stripped.jpg" alt="" />, <img src="../img/cnpr_blue.jpg" alt="" />, <img src="../img/cnpr_purple.jpg" alt="" />, <img src="../img/cnpr_red.jpg" alt="" />, <img src="../img/cnpr_yellow.jpg" alt="" /> and <img src="../img/cnpr_green.jpg" alt="" />. The more symbols participate in the winning combination, the bigger the payout. Once a winning combination occurs and is paid, it explodes thus enabling more symbols to drop down and form new combinations.</p>
			<p><strong>Game Max Win Capping:</strong></p>
			<p>The maximum paytable prize applies to a single screen without any additional wins.</p>
			<p>The maximum prize per single bet applies to the maximum prize achieved by any win combination in a maximum of 100 consecutive screens.</p>
			<p><a name="cnpr_jackpot"></a><strong>Sweet Party Progressive Jackpot</strong></p>
			<p>A winning combination of 8 to 25 <img src="../img/cnpr_stripped.jpg" alt="" /> wins the Jackpot, while the relative percentage of the Jackpot win is determined by the size of the player&rsquo;s bet:</p>
			<p>&euro;1 bet wins 10% of the progressive jackpot</p>
			<p>&euro;2 bet wins 20% of the progressive jackpot</p>
			<p>&euro;5 bet wins 50% of the progressive jackpot</p>
			<p>&euro;10 bet wins 100% of the progressive jackpot</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> The full jackpot can only be won if the player places the maximum possible bet in the game.</p>
			<p>1% of each player&rsquo;s bet in all game rounds played online in all online casinos, is added to the progressive jackpot in the following way: 0.5% will go towards the seed and 0.5% to the increment of the current jackpot. When the seed reaches the maximum possible total bet (configured by the casino operator) x 10,000, the percentage of the players&rsquo; bets stops feeding the seed and goes directly to the progressive part.</p>
			<p>The Jackpot ticker field is constantly updated according to the current player&rsquo;s bet.</p>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> If 2 or more players win the jackpot at the same time, the wins are distributed as follows:</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Player 1 places a bet that makes him eligible to win the progressive jackpot.</li>
			<li>Players 2, 3, etc. will then only win the seed as the progressive part has already been won by Player 1.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the game is terminated while winning the jackpot, a screen summarizing the jackpot winnings will be shown upon resuming the game. More information can be found in the <strong>Note on disconnections</strong> section at the bottom of this page.</p>
			<p><strong>Return to Player</strong></p>
			<p>The theoretical percentage return to player (RTP) is 93.97%.</p>
